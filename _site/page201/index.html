  <p>I wrote before about how strange it was that Dean supporters weren’t bothered by Joe Trippi’s partnership in the company that had been hired to make Dean’s campaign ads. But now it seems that Trippi and Dean are fighting over “control of the campaign’s bounty of grass-roots supporters“!

  <p>I would like to retract an earlier post. I suggested that the Democrats try to use “states rights” to re-frame the issue of same sex marriage. But in last night’s debate, Al Sharpton set me straight:


  I think is not an issue any more of just marriage. This is an issue of human rights. And I think it is dangerous to give states the right to de...</p>

  <p>So it turns out that the biggest act of (terrorist?) sabotage this century was committed by the CIA:


  “In order to disrupt the Soviet gas supply, its hard currency earnings from the West, and the internal Russian economy, the pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines, and valves was programmed to go haywire, after a decent interva...</p>

  <p>I’ve only seen Murphy beds in movies, and then usually as part of some joke where someone accidentally gets folded away with the bed in the closet. So I was very happy to read a story about them in the Jackson Heights newsletter, Views form the Heights. The story is by Robyn Einhorn, an MA candidate at Parsons School of Design who is researching...</p>

  It is hard to see much democracy in the distribution of stock ownership. THe bottom half of the population held 1.4% of total stock in 2001, with an average portfolio of just over $3,000. And since only a minority of bottom-half households own any stock, that average is deceptively high. … If you sort households by their stockholdings (exclud...</p>

  <p>Is the tide turning? Is Bush loosing his grip? There do indeed seem to be signs that he has simply gone too far for many of his most ardent supporters.

Today, Andrew Sullivan, a senior editor at the new republic and ardent defender of Bush, said this:


  The president launched a war today against the civil rights of gay citizens and their fami...</p>

  <p>Scott Sommers discusses some of the shortcomings of the Social Science Citation Index. I would add that the problem goes beyond the fact that the index is so incomplete, or that the user interface can be frustrating and difficult to use: I think it is a more fundamental problem with the entire antiquated academic publishing industry. Lets put as...</p>
