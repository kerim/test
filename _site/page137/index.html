  <p>Robert Sapolsky has spent much of his life studying Baboon society. While Baboons are not human, they, along with other higher primates, share with humans the ability to be stressed out.

  <p>Speaking in the House on July 27, 1848, Congressman Abraham Lincoln of Illinois tried to explain why he was first against the (Mexican-American) war, and then was for it:

  <p>Dalton Conley has an interesting Op-Ed in the NY Times suggesting that Democrats accept a more regressive taxation system (i.e. taxing sales instead of wealth) in exchange for better funding of social welfare policies:

  In Iraq, counselors are helping U.S. soldiers develop coping skills so that they can handle the stress of combat. But doctors are finding growing anxiety among Iraqi people who see themselves as caught in a helpless situation. NPR’s Emily Harris reports.

  <p>When I first met Suketu Mehta he was deep in conversation with someone who was grilling him about his experiences writing the Bollywood action flick, “Mission Kashmir,” which he had written the screenplay for.
