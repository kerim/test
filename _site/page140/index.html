  <p>Welcome to the ranks!


  A dissident is a person that actively opposes the established order. The term is most often used to refer to political dissidents, usually against oppressive regimes. Political dissidents usually refer to non-violent means, which can range from voicing criticism of the government to attempts to displace or overthrow the...</p>

  <p>There is no doubt in my mind that if Kerry had voted against the war he would have won by a clear margin. No war record could possibly make him look like a hero when he showed a failure of courage and resolve at that moment. Sometimes supporting a war can make you look weak.

I’ve been holding back on Kerry’s support of the war because of the ca...</p>

  <p>Couldn’t sleep. Ohio still too close to call. How could it be so close? Perhaps the answer is in the story of Ms. Medvedeva, a “young, brown-eyed and curvy, a pediatric dentist who quotes 19th-century poetry and cooks delicious meals. She lives near the Caspian Sea in southern Russia but is eager to travel.”


  Ms. Medvedeva is one of scores, p...</p>

  <p>The New York Times finally has a story on the locked out workers,  here:


  Classic bread-and-butter issues were on the table, including wage increases, costs of health benefits, pension changes, a right-to-organize clause and the length of the contract.

  But talks stalled in September when the union balked at proposed health and pension conc...</p>

  <p>CNN seems like a good place to be online tonight:



Here is where they will post state-by-state data as it rolls in. From the above map it seems like it isn’t worth checking in till after 9 PM eastern standard time.

If you know of better sites, leave them in the comments.

UPDATE: CSPAN is good too.
