I woke up to see this holocaust outside our house. It seems that one of our neighbors who is a member of the home-owners association was complaining about ants coming into her house from the trees, so the solution was to cut them all down.

So now, instead of the beautiful dappled light and green leaves we used to see outside our window, we se...</p>

When I was telling people I wanted a compact camera which could perform well at a high ISO, I think many misunderstood. What I really should have said is, I want to be able to take low-light pictures without a flash. This picture was taken using my DMC-LX2’s intelligent ISO mode, which selected an ISO rating of 250. There is no reason for me t...</p>

After much deliberation I finally got a Panasonic DMC-LX2. The main competitor was the yet-to-be-announced LX3, and what finally made my decision was spending some time looking at this timeline of camera product announcements which made it pretty clear that it was unlikely for any new camera to be announced before the new year, and certainly n...</p>

I wanted to announce two projects which I think should be useful for English speaking residents of the Taiwanese interweb:


  First is a Yahoo! Pipes feed which aggregates Michael, David, and Bent’s roundups of the English language blogsphere in Taiwan. That’s one RSS feed just for their link roundup posts. You can view it on the web at http:...</p>

The other day I went to see an interesting performance built up around the life and work of Gao Yi-sheng 高一生. Who is Gao Yi-Sheng? There isn’t much about him in English on the web, but here is a short blurb from the Taipei Times:


  Better known by his Chinese name of Kao Yi-sheng (高一生), Uyongu Yatauyungana was the mayor of the Tsou Aborigina...</p>

I would like to congratulate Australia on finally ridding itself of John Howard. In 2002 I wrote about ““Howard’s openly racist policies” and more recently we’ve had some excellent discussion on Savage Minds about his use of the “Little Children are Sacred” report to undo decades of progress on Aborigine autonomy. I’d really begun to give up o...</p>

  <p>I finally finished editing and uploading my photos from last February’s shoot in Chharanagar. I did a lot of portraits this time, but haven’t yet updated the information about who is who. You can see the slideshow here (or click on the photo).
