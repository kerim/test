  <p>This Foreign Affairs article by George J. Gilboy focuses on trade between China and the U.S., but it has some good news for Taiwan. I remember reading many alarmist articles a few years ago, at the time that both Taiwan and China entered the WTO, about how China was catching up with Taiwan in the hi-tech sector, and how Taiwan simply wouldn&#821...</p>

  <p>I find it difficult to write about New Orleans. I&#8217;ve only visited the city twice, but really loved it. I especially loved the wonderful hospitality I received there. When I was there 12 years ago my friend (who I hope is OK!) told me about the potential for such a disaster. In 2002 I watched this episode of NOW with Bill Moyers which state...</p>

  <p>A sixth of the world&#8217;s population lives on less than a dollar a day. Most of these 1.2 billion people are women, and they spend a significant amount of their day gathering fuel:

  <p>Writing in the *Asia Times*, Zafar Anjum explores why China&#8217;s film industry has netted so much love from Hollywood, while India hasn&#8217;t produced a single art-house hit since Lagaan won the best foreign language film Oscar in 2001. Part of his answer is that the Indian film industry is content to live off of its loyal viewers:

Seems that violent worker protests aren&#8217;t unique to China, and &#8220;Made in Taiwan&#8221; does not ensure that something is made under humane working conditions.
