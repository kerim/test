  The answer to problems like the Pentagon’s accounting system clearly is not more flexibility — what is needed is more accountability. Accountability within the Department, accountability to Congress, which means accountability to the Constitution and accountability to the American people.

  <p>Nothing seems to get Democrats more upset these days than memories of the Nader campaign. In Rage Against the Machine’s music video, Testify (produced by Michael Moore during the last presidential elections), alien beings take control of America by running cloned candidates against each other.

  <p>At least 20% of the Guantanamo detainees have been held without charges for years even though they were innocent. These are just the ones that the government plans to release. Only time will tell about the other 80%. Many were victims of Afghan Warlords who sold them for bounty to the U.S. military. These innocent detainees still haven’t been re...</p>

  <p>When I was in college I took a year off and backpacked around Asia for a while. I’m glad I did it then, since it is a lot more expensive to travel in that part of the world now. I was able to live for about $5 a day, $7 if you average in transportation costs. What limited me wasn’t the cost of travel, but weight. The very first day I got off the...</p>

  <p>I totally missed this brilliant post from Nathan Newman, written about three weeks ago. He discusses allegations of liberal censorship of conservative speech on College Campuses and takes a surprisingly refreshing new take on the topic:

  <p>The New York Times must have turned over a new leaf this holiday season. In just the past few days there have been four excellent Op-Ed contributions on the economy, calling into question some of the established Liberal orthodoxies on free trade, consumerism, and productivity, as well as one article on how Republicans hide the real unemployment ...</p>

  <p>How to deal with institutions that simply don’t “get” the internet? In response to a call by Body and Soul, I wrote the L.A. Times and requested that they institute permanent links to stories so that scholars and bloggers can link to their stories without worrying that these links would become out-of-date. Not providing permanent links to indivi...</p>
