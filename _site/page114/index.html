  <p>A recent compendium and analysis of U.S. labor market statistics, the *State of Working America*, has some interesting data that is relevant to the passing of the new bankruptcy law. Bush is eager to promote the bill as good for poor people, but the statistics show a society divided between those who own assets and those who own debt:

  <p>Over one million U.S. soldiers have served in the wars following 9/11. In just three and half years that&#8217;s &#8220;one-third the number of troops ever stationed in or around Vietnam during 15 years of that conflict!&#8221;

  <p>In March, I posted a letter by a friend, Thom Powers, to Hillary Clinton. He suggested that the solution to concerns about sex and violence in the media isn&#8217;t more studies, or censorship, or even V-chips, but supporting quality programing on PBS.

I mention this because I think this is exactly the kind of thinking that Amy Sullivan had in ...</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m sick and tired of all these attacks on Paris Hilton! She is not simply some rich heiress who can be used as a convenient excuse not to repeal the estate tax. She is a *media personality*! Moreover, the central argument: that repealing the estate tax will cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion per decade

  <p>Even though the new bankruptcy law will hit New Yorkers harder than the population as a whole, New York congressman Joseph Crowley was one of 73 Democrats who voted *for* the bill. He was even a co-sponsor!

John Edwards, on the other hand, recently admitted that he was mistaken to have voted for a similar bill in 2001:

  <p>Back in 2003 I wrote this post about how DNA can reveal people to have very different genetic backgrounds than what their ethnicity might otherwise tell them. Today the *New York Times* offers some more stories. Genia Stevens provides a short summary:
