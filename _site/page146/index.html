  So orders came down from the generals in Baghdad, we want to clear the village, like in Samarra. And as he told the story, another platoon from his company came and executed all the guards, as his people were screaming, stop. And he said they just shot them one by one. He went nuts, and his soldiers went nuts. And he’s hysterical. He’s totall...</p>

  <p>I guess it was just a matter of time. Photo blogs have been around for a long time already (I’ve even added one to my sidebar), as well as MP3 blogs, so why not video blogs? I just had time to watch Chris Weagel’s “All Part of My Plan” which I enjoyed. I’m still waiting for the tools that will make it as easy for me to quote a snippet of someone...</p>

  <p>Kevin Drum points to two very important articles (actually four, since the second one contains three parts). These are both really worth your time, and I don’t have anything to add beyond Kevin’s excellent posts, so I’ll just briefly cite him:

First, there is the LA Times’ article “If America Is Richer, Why Are Its Families So Much Less Secure?...</p>

  <p>Derrida (1930-2004) famously argued that writing preceded speech. By this I believe he meant that the “iterability” of language logically preceded its spontaneous performance.


  that is, repeatable in any context whatsoever, just as this very introduction to Derrida I’m writing now must be able to signify as an introduction to Derrida after th...</p>

  <p>Amy Fisher, AKA “the Long Island Lolita,” has a new book: If I Knew Then. Here is a snippet from the AP news story:


  Fisher speaks candidly in the book about her teenage tryst with car mechanic Joey Buttafuoco and the events that led her to his wife’s doorstep in May 1992, where she shot the woman in the head, thinking it was what he wanted.
