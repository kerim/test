  <p>As a new DVD, “Faith in the White House,” portrays Bush as “God’s essential and irreplaceable warrior on Earth,” it is worth asking the question: Why doesn’t Bush go to church? In a recent NRO article, Amy Sullivan asks just that:


  The very fact that the president doesn’t attend church, some leading conservatives insist, is proof of what a go...</p>

  <p>Kerry was much more clear and articulate than usual, and he didn’t mess up. Bush sounded a little nervous at times, and his sticking so closely to his talking points made him seem a little forced. I personally don’t think the debates could possible hurt Bush, since his supporters seem impervious to even the grimmest realities of war, not to ment...</p>

  <p>Reading this NY Times article about how parents and students have thwarted attempts by schools to ban cell phones reminded me of an incident in the library the other day. In the study where I work most people put their cell phones on vibrate, or at least some barely audible chirp that only goes off once before they run outside the room to answer...</p>

  <p>Why do we hold elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November?


  Why early November? For much of our history America was a predominantly agrarian society. Law makers therefore took into account that November was perhaps the most convenient month for farmers and rural workers to be able to travel to the polls. The fall harves...</p>
