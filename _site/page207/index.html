  More than 10,000 civilians, many of them women and children, have been killed so far in the Iraqi conflict, The Independent on Sunday has learnt, making the continuing conflict the most deadly war for non-combatants waged by the West since the Vietnam war more than 30 years ago.

  <p>This article on Afghanistan, from the New York Review of Books, is so important that I thought it worth condensing and presenting on my web page. I&#8217;ve removed a lot of important details, but kept what I thought were the most important points. I had to do this because NY Review articles only remain freely available online for a limited time...</p>

  <p>This is the stupidest, most idiotic, thing I have read in a long time. And this isn&#8217;t the only place I have seen such remarks on the web. While it is not unlikely to assume that al Qaeda might attack the U.S. at some point close to the November elections, it is stupid to assume that this will hurt Bush. Look at history, look at 9-11, look ...</p>

  <p>As Kerry solidifies his lead as the Democratic frontrunner, I decided it was time I learned something about who he is. Everyone knows some of the more widely publicized facts of his life: that he was a Vietnam war hero who then became a leading anti-war activist, that his paternal grandparents were Czech Jews who converted to Catholicism and ado...</p>

  <p>In my post on Kerry, I mentioned that I felt Edwards had the kind of leadership qualities I thought Kerry was lacking. Here is what William Saletan has to say about the &#8220;most audacious speech of the 2004 presidential season&#8221; (the most audacious speech of the 2003 season was delivered by Howard Dean):

This new Australian train line which connects the South to the North for the first time, is called the &#8220;Ghan&#8221; in honor of the Afghan camel riders who were instrumental in opening up Southern Australia. I managed to find a web page dedicated to the history of these Afghans who, it turns out, weren&#8217;t all Afghan, but included pe...</p>
