  <p>Question: When is an Arab not an Arab?

Answer: When its a story in the New York Times.

I used to have a ritual of buying the Sunday Times, but the reporting has gotten so bad (more here) that I can’t even do that anymore. Sure, there are still some good reporters working there – it is a large organization. But I would rather not have to spend ...</p>

  <p>How efficient is America’s privatized health care system?

According to Paul Krugman:


  A recent study found that private insurance companies spend 11.7 cents of every health care dollar on administrative costs, mainly advertising and underwriting, compared with 3.6 cents for Medicare and 1.3 cents for Canada’s government-run system.


And acc...</p>

  “Al Gore proved that you can win the election without a single Southern state, if he’d only won New Hampshire,” Kerry told a group of San Francisco Democrats in March.


Is this true? According to a very thoughtful article in the American Prospect, co-written by Emerging Democratic Majority blogger Ruy Teixeira and Cliff Schecter, the answer ...</p>

  <p>This is an upsetting abuse of copyright laws. On what grounds can anyone justify giving Joyce’s heirs 70+ more years of copyright to his work?


  James Joyce died in 1941 and the copyright in his work expired in 1991. Then the EU extended terms to life+70 years, and the work went back into copyright in July 1995. The estate has been very active...</p>

  <p>Can you guess which draft-dodging presidential candidate said this?


  The thing about the Vietnam War that troubles me as I look back was it was a political war.  We had politicians making military decisions, and it is lessons that any president must learn…

  “We were all wrong,” says weapons inspector David Kay. Actually, no. There was one group whose prewar estimates of Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities have turned out to be devastatingly close to reality—the U.N. inspectors.


This is an important point, not just for understanding what went wrong in Iraq, but also as the Presi...</p>
