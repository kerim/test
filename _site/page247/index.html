  </h2>
  <p>>   Under the new law, Congress has &#8220;taken the unprecedented step&#8221; of dictating to federal judges what sentences must be imposed. Since 1986, when the U.S. Sentencing Commission was established, that role has belonged to the Commission.


Talk Left has a good discussion of why that is wrong.

  <p>>   Most taxpayers will receive a $400-a-child check in the mail this summer as a result of the law, which raises the child tax credit, to $1,000 from $600. It had been clear from the beginning that the wealthiest families would not receive the credit, which is intended to phase out at high incomes.
