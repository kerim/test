  <p>I haven&#8217;t been doing much John Edwards blogging since he announced his candidacy, but back in February I had bookmarked two articles about Edwards&#8217; health care plan which I thought worth sharing.

  <p>The Employee Free Choice Act passed the house vote, now it is going to the senate. If you are a US citizen, please go here to tell your senator that they should pass this important bill!

Why is this important? The standard method (NLRB elections by secret ballot) are much more prone to coercion by management:

  <p>I know I&#8217;m not the only one who will miss Ze, as he ends his one year video blog which rocked the interweb.

I think the secret to Ze&#8217;s success is that he is a great teacher. He taught his audience how to participate and how to be creative. Here is an interview he did with On the Media&#8217;s Bob Garfield:

  <p>I honestly don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be blogging about Juno every Thursday, but since she takes up so much of my blogging time I figure I might as well share some of these photos. Juno&#8217;s a fast learner and she&#8217;s quickly becoming much more manageable. Of course, when another dog is around that all goes out the window, but there i...</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve recently gotten very good at using WordPress to power static websites. The reason being that recent changes to WordPress have made it really easy to do so. Most people think of WorPress as a blogging platform, and that is what it is setup to do out of the box. However, a few minor adjustments and you can hide the blog completely, or m...</p>
