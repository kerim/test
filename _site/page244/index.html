  <p>From SF Gate:


  A new rifle-launched gas grenade, invented by the U.S. Army ostensibly for nonlethal crowd control, has created a stir because the patent filed on the technology claims that it can deliver chemical and biological agents, two payloads forbidden by international treaty and U.S. law.

  <p>Here are some letters to the NY Times that respond to many of the same issues I raised in my earlier post.

Dr. Leanne Hinton


  The movement toward revitalization of endangered languages is a community-generated process, not a linguist-generated process. Furthermore, it is the younger generations who are in the leadership roles.

  <p>
  The number of children in Iraq suffering from diarrhoea and related diseases appears to have risen dramatically in the past year, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) said on Sunday.

  The incidence of diseases such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid was 2.5 times higher this May than for the same month last year, said Unicef spokesman...</p>

  <p>It seems that there is some credence to Fox News’ claims to deliver balanced reporting. Even though they were more overtly pro-war than any other network news outlet, FAIR has a report which shows they also had more anti-war guests than either PBS or CBC!!!
