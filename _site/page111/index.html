  <p>Why is New York City spending millions of dollars advertising the Olympics to its own citizens? I’m sick and tired of seeing ads for the Olympics everywhere I go. Personally, I don’t even think having the olympics in New York is a good idea. Here is what Forbes magazine has to say:

  Fei Xiaotong 孝通 (1910-2005), who died on Sunday in Beijing, is best remembered for his passion for sociology and anthropology.


Full story in the China Daily. I’ll add more links here as I come across them.

UPDATE: A nice biography of Fei Xiaotong.

UPDATE: JJ has a bunch of excellent links to books by (and about) Fei in English.

  <p>What really impresses me about President Bush is his almost instinctual ability to choose and elevate to positions of power people who go beyond the call of duty in suppressing information that conflicts with his policy decisions. In a recent post I discussed memos written by Alberto Gonzales (who Bush would like to make a Supreme Court justice)...</p>

  The US prison population has risen further, with one in 138 people now in jail, new official figures reveal.

  There are more than 2.1 million US citizens in jail – more than in any other country, the Bureau of Justice Statistics says.

  …It means the incarceration rate reached a record of 726 people per 100,000 residents.

  John Norvell has thrown his hat into the ring with anthroblogs.org, an MT install with a few blogs on them, including his own and a group blog of which he seems so far to be the only contributor. There is also a wiki on anthropology which at the moment is more or less empty. This last project, ...</p>

  <p>I honestly don’t remember much about Colin Pine. He was a classmate of mine at ICLP in Taipei, where I studied Chinese for a year. Studying Chinese was such a difficult and intense experience for me that I didn’t have much time to socialize with my fellow classmates, but Colin was one of those outgoing people who made learning a foreign language...</p>
