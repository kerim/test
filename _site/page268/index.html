  <p>Surly the idiocy of Bill Keller’s column in the NY Times is obvious and I don’t have to refute it point-by-point? I mean, what can you say about a piece that ends with the claim that the problem with Rumsfeld is just that he isn’t nice to people?


  The lesson of this week’s intramural bickering, I think, is less about war than about management...</p>

  In Iraq, everything comes from Hussein, not only what is painful but also what is good. Protection from enemies and privation comes from Hussein, even if the enemies and privation were also brought on by Hussein. Food comes from Hussein. Life itself, for many Iraqis, comes from Hussein.

  Is it surprising that some Iraqis, perhaps many, woul...</p>

  <p>This is from an interview with a non-embedded journalist who was one of several arrested by US forces in Iraq:


  After we were arrested at six o’ clock in the morning by these guys, and at about 11:30 I think it was, some five and a half hours after we were arrested, he kind of lost his patience, the Portuguese guy, and they put us in our jeep...</p>

  “We discovered a base with tents, food, weapons. It was here that Taliban coming from Pakistan would stay before moving out to other parts of the country,” said Fazluddin Agha, district police chief of Spin Boldak.

  Behind the rhetoric from Damascus is concern that top officials in the Bush administration have targeted Syria as the next country for a change in government.

  While in central Baghdad the war has arrived as a series of interruptions to daily life, Sueb and the other extremities of this vast city are being softened up for America’s assault. Here, as in other outlying areas of Baghdad, civilians are also paying the price for living close to enticing targets.

  <p>Brilliant!


  So if there was a country that could justly have been accused of “accommodating Nazi evil” in the period around 1940, its name isn’t actually “France.”
