  <p>
  The fact that George W Bush borrowed money from BCCI in 1987 but John Kerry launched the investigation in 1988 that eventually brought them down really says about all you need to know about the character of the two men.


This is exactly what caught my eye when I first looked into Kerry’s record back in February – but now there is a new artic...</p>

  <p>I’ve been holding off writing a post about Benjamin Lee Whorf thinking that I would wait until I had time to do the topic justice; but the announcement (more here) of a new article in Science has caused a flurry of posts around the internet, and I felt that it was an opportune time to make a simple point: Whorf never said that language determine...</p>

  Yes, there is a little gulag in New York City. It is located in Queens and its name is the Wackenhut Detention Center. And everybody should know about the more than 200 human beings languishing behind its walls.


Especially since they are now on a hunger strike.

  <p>Everything you ever wanted to know about Halliburton, and more. Like this juicy tidbit:


  Halliburton announced yesterday that the Army would withhold 15 percent of future payments because of suspicious bills. A few hours later, the Army announced it would not withhold those payments, but would instead give Halliburton more time to explain why...</p>

  <p>First, a little background:


  A cheese steak sandwich is not really a steak at all – it is a sandwich made with chipped steak, steak that has been frozen and sliced really thin) and cooked on a grill top. Locals think in terms of steak sandwiches with or without cheese. Without cheese, the sandwich is referred to as a steak. With cheese, it is...</p>

  <p>I love WordPress. Not just because it is Open Source, but because it is written in the PHP coding language. (I like PHP because it is easy to modify, and changes are reflected instantly on your web site, unlike MovableType which I am using now.) I used WordPress to setup Shashwati’s web site and blog; but I’ve been hesitant to switch Keywords be...</p>

  <p>There was a lot of attention paid to the fact that Republicans in Florida were pushing voters to cast absentee ballots. But it seems that this is a much more widespread phenomenon, and that both parties are urging supporters to lock in their vote in a number of states where it is legal to vote early by absentee ballot.
