      <p>I rarely (never) go to see Broadway musicals, so perhaps I am not the best person to be criticizing them, but a friend got us free tickets to <em>Bombay Dreams</em> so we went. It was beyond awful. Manish Vij <a href="http://www.vij.com/archive/the_bombay_dreams_reviews_train_wreck.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vij.com/archive/the_bombay_dreams_reviews_train_wreck.html', 'summarizes the reviews']);">summarizes the reviews</a> of this train wreck on his blog. Manish actually liked this musical – to each his own, I suppose. Personally I was ready to crawl out of my seat during a musical number entitled “Love’s Never Easy.” Eeeeech!</p>

<p>But what really upset me is that there was a complete and total disregard for the Bollywood movie genre which the musical is supposed to be a tribute to. With one notable exception (involving a wet-sari dance number) the songs were worse than your typical Andrew Lloyd Weber drivel (best parodied in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098436/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098436/', 'The Tall Guy']);">The Tall Guy</a>, where Jeff Goldbloom sings in a musical version of <em>The Elephant Man</em>). A big hit in Lodon, the show was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/theater/reviews/30BOMB.html?ei=5007&#038;en=b7823b88720204d3&#038;ex=1398657600&#038;partner=USERLAND&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/theater/reviews/30BOMB.html?ei=5007&amp;en=b7823b88720204d3&amp;ex=1398657600&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=', 're-written for American audiences']);">re-written for American audiences</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In bringing “Bombay Dreams” to the States, its creators have retooled it in the hopes of making it more accessible to Bollywood virgins. Meera Syal’s original script, which follows a young man’s speedy rise from the lower depths to the height of movie stardom, has had its plot streamlined and its one-liners plumped up via the three-time Tony-winning writer Thomas Meehan (“Annie,” “The Producers,” “Hairspray”). Much of an involved criminal subplot, with attendant acts of stylized violence, has been jettisoned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thomas Meehan? There are so many talented South Asian writers in New York, couldn’t they at least have found someone who has watched a Hindi movie? Even worse, and I don’t know if this was in Meera Syal’s original script or not, the musical depends upon the premise that the main character’s impoverished lower-caste background is a barrier to a career in the movies. Quite to the contrary, several big Bollywood stars flaunt such backgrounds whenever they can. It sounds to me like a story that would make more sense in class conscious England than it would in India. As the <em>New York Times</em> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a Broadway show set in Bombay that has arrived by way of London, this musical winds up suggesting another provenance altogether: Las Vegas, land of the flashy floor show and simulacra of foreign metropolises, where live entertainment exists mostly as lavish background noise.</p>
