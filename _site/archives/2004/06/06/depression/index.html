      <p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968 said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When there is massive unemployment in the black community, it is called a social problem. But when there is massive unemployment in the white community, it is called a depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Betsy Leondar-Wright has an <a href="http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=18864" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=18864', 'important article']);">important article</a> about how history is repeating itself, with African Americans being disproportionately affected by the current “economic recovery” (i.e. depression):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unemployment for adult black workers rose by 2.9 percentage points in the recession of the early 1980s, but by 3.5 in the 2001 recession. White unemployment, in contrast, rose by only 1.4 percentage points in the early 1980s recession and by 1.7 in the recent downturn. The median income of black families fell 3% from 2001 to 2003, while white families lost just 1.7%. Today, black unemployment has remained above 10% for over three years.</p>

  <p>Official unemployment figures, of course, greatly understate the actual number of adults without jobs. The definition doesn’t include discouraged people who have stopped looking for work, underemployed part-timers, students, or those in prison or other institutions. In New York City, scarcely half of African-American men between 16 and 65 had jobs in 2003, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ employment-to-population ratios for the city. The BLS ratios, which include discouraged workers and others the official unemployment statistics leave out, were 51.8% for black men, 57.1% for black women, 75.7% for white men, and 65.7% for Latino men. The figure for black men was the lowest on record (since 1979).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news is even worse, since African Americans often lack other forms of wealth, such has homeownership and social networks, upon which the white population is able to draw in difficult times:</p>
