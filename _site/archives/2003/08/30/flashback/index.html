      <p>A huge amount of discussion over at <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000410.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000410.html', 'Crooked Timber']);">Crooked Timber</a>, and now <a href="http://calpundit.com/archives/002038.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://calpundit.com/archives/002038.html', 'Calpudit']);">Calpudit</a>, about the use of Time Travel in fictional narratives. I have to say that I find Brian Weatherson’s approach to be very limiting. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Philosophers normally break time-travel stories into two categories: those that do make sense within a ‘one-dimensional’ view of time and those that don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this distinction he means movies “require that there be a single complete and coherent story that can be told of the history of the world” and those which don’t. He offers <em>12 Monkies</em> as an example of the one-dimensional view (albeit a clever one), and <em>Back to the Future</em> as one where time-travel produces alternate versions of the future. But here is my problem – as a philosopher why does he feel constrained by the same narrative conventions as the works he addresses? That is, why does he feel it necessary to talk about time-travel movies in their own terms? While it does have the benefit of simplifying the discussion, isn’t it important to recognize that time-travel is simply a <em>narrative device</em>? Once we accept that, how is the one-dimensional view of time-travel any different from a <em>flashback</em>? Think about a movie like <em>Memento</em>. How is that any different from a time travel movie?</p>

<p>I raise this point because I think <em>Momento</em> is actually a better interpretation of the notion of time represented by <em>La Jetée</em>, the film that inspired <em>12 Monkies</em>. The reason is that narratively <em>La Jetée</em> is told as a series of still pictures. Chris Marker (the director of <em>La Jetée</em>) is actually playing with the whole concept of cinematic narrative which is usually told linearly at 24 frames per a second. Instead, he makes us question what it means for one picture to follow another, much the same way that the main character in <em>Momento</em> must reconstruct his past each day from the still pictures he took the day before. On the other hand, <em>12 Monkies</em> is really just another linear Hollywood movie.</p>

<p>Once we open up the discussion in this way, it is possible to include movies like <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em> and <em>Rashomon</em>. Both of these films involve the actors narratively reconstructing the past, rather than simply “going back in time” in some literal sense. This introduces a third relationship between the past and the present – one in which the past and the present are constantly influencing each other through the stories we tell about them.</p>
