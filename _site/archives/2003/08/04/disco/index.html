So I didn’t really appreciate Saturday Night Fever when it came out. But I just saw the movie again on TV, and it isn’t half bad. It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0054599" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/Title?0054599', 'Pasolini&#8217;s Accattone']);">Pasolini’s Accattone</a>. Like that film, the painful parts are somehow forgotten after viewing, and we just remember the fun parts. As <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/greatmovies/saturdaynight.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/greatmovies/saturdaynight.html', 'Roger Ebert says']);">Roger Ebert says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most lasting images are its joyous ones, of Tony strutting down a sidewalk, dressing for the evening and dominating the disco floor in a solo dance that audiences often applaud. There’s a lot in the movie that’s sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking around on the web I just found out that the film was originally based on journalistic account of the real 2001 Odyssey disco club in Brooklyn by <em>New York</em> writer Nik Cohn. At first I thought – no wonder the story is so good, it is based on a real account of life in Bay Ridge. But the same Google search informed me that on the 20th anniversary of the film Nick Cohn <a href="http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,2190,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,2190,00.html', 'admitted to having faked the whole story']);">admitted to having faked the whole story</a>:<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>The British writer describes how he went to Brooklyn’s now legendary 2001 Odyssey searching in vain for a flamboyantly dressed fellow he had spotted in the club’s entrance a week earlier. “I didn’t learn much…I made a lousy interviewer: I knew nothing about this world, and it showed. Quite literally, I didn’t speak the language.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;#8220;So I faked it. I conjured up the story of the figure in the doorway, and named him Vincent&amp;#8230;I wrote it all up. And presented it as fact,&amp;#8221; Cohn confesses. &amp;#8220;There was no excuse for it&amp;#8230;I knew the rules of magazine reporting, and I knew that I was breaking them. Bluntly put, I cheated.&amp;#8221;

<p>I guess he was just a good writer! Or maybe it was the screenplay writer, Norman Wexler who was also one of the writers for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0070666#writers" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0070666#writers', 'Serpico']);">Serpico</a>? He seems to also have been an interesting case. He was arrested in 1972 “by the FBI for saying he was planning to shoot then-president Nixon.” Well, it is certainly a better reason to be arrested than <a href="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2003-07-17/rant.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2003-07-17/rant.html', 'reading a magazine article in a coffee shop']);">reading a magazine article in a coffee shop</a>!</p>

<p>BONUS LINK: You may have noticed the numbered arrows in the picture of John Travolta.
