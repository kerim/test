      <blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Blix took issue with what he said were Secretary of State Colin L. Powell’s claims that the inspectors had found that Iraqi officials were hiding and moving illicit materials within and outside of Iraq to prevent their discovery. He said that the inspectors had reported no such incidents.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Similarly, he said, he had not seen convincing evidence that Iraq was sending weapons scientists to Syria, Jordan or any other country to prevent them from being interviewed. Nor had he any reason to believe, as President Bush charged in his State of the Union speech, that Iraqi agents were posing as scientists.
  
  
  
He further disputed the Bush administration&amp;#8217;s allegations that his inspection agency might have been penetrated by Iraqi agents, and that sensitive information might have been leaked to Baghdad, compromising the inspections.
  
  
  
Finally, he said, he had seen no persuasive indications of Iraqi ties to Al Qaeda, which Mr. Bush also mentioned in his speech. &amp;#8220;There are other states where there appear to be stronger links,&amp;#8221; such as Afghanistan, Mr. Blix said, noting that he had no intelligence reports on this issue. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s bad enough that Iraq may have weapons of mass destruction.&amp;#8221;
