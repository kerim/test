Here is what he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s take the hawks at their word that Iraq is a front on the war against terror, and that stabilizing Iraq is a key part of winning the war. You might not believe it, but that’s their case.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>But if it&amp;#8217;s true, then surely stabilizing Afghanistan is at least as important? In fact, given the large amount of known al-Qaeda activity in Afghanistan and the continuing Taliban presence there, you could make a pretty good argument that keeping a lid on Afghanistan is more important than Iraq.
  
  
  
But in any case, surely it&amp;#8217;s not a mere one-tenth as important , as the administration seems to think based on its troop commitments and reconstruction funding there? Especially given the continuing reports that &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/central/09/08/afghanistan.1/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/central/09/08/afghanistan.1/index.html', 'this is the place where the terrorists are regrouping, not Iraq']);" &gt;this is the place where the terrorists are regrouping, not Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/blockquote&gt; 


  Note that these figures are based on the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030908-1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030908-1.html', 'Bush administration&amp;#8217;s own high-end estimates']);" &gt;Bush administration&amp;#8217;s own high-end estimates&lt;/a&gt;, which have a &lt;a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/TCS/PressReleases/11-01-02iraq.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taxpayer.net/TCS/PressReleases/11-01-02iraq.htm', 'history of being notoriously low']);" &gt;history of being notoriously low&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/guns_and_money_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/guns_and_money_.html', 'Body and Soul']);" &gt;Body and Soul&lt;/a&gt;)! But that&amp;#8217;s not the real issue, as &lt;a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/choices.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/09/choices.html', 'Body and Soul']);" &gt;Body and Soul&lt;/a&gt; points out, 78% of this money is going to the military. From the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/politics/09COST.html?pagewanted=print&amp;#38;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/politics/09COST.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=', 'NY Times article']);" &gt;NY Times article&lt;/a&gt;:


&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
    President Bush&amp;#8217;s $87 billion request for postwar costs is heavily weighted to maintaining military operations, with $65.5 billion directed to the armed forces, $15 billion toward rebuilding Iraq and $5 billion toward building its security forces, and $800 million to new spending for civilian programs in Afghanistan, administration officials said today.
  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


  The article reveals just how far off Bush &amp; Co.&amp;#8217;s accounting can be:


&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
    Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told a House subcommittee in March that Iraq could generate $50 billion to $100 billion of oil revenue over the next two to three years. &amp;#8220;We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon,&amp;#8221; Mr. Wolfowitz said at the time. 
    
    
      &amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;It is fair to say that the level of decay and underinvestment in the Iraqi infrastructure was worse than almost anyone on the outside anticipated,&amp;#8221; a senior administration official said today.
    
    
    
      Administration officials said they now expect Iraqi oil revenues to increase from zero this year to $12.1 billion next year and $20 billion a year in 2005 and 2006.
    
  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


  But to get back to the difference in spending between Afghanistan and Iraq, could it be because there is no oil in Afghanistan?
