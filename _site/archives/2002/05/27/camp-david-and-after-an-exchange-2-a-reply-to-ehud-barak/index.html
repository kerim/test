      <blockquote>
  <p>“The Palestinians did insist that Israel recognize that it bore responsibility for creating the problem of the refugees. But it is ironic that Barak would choose to convey his categorical rejection of any such Israeli historical responsibility to Benny Morris, an Israeli historian called “revisionist” in large part for his account of the origins of the displacement of the Palestinians and for his conclusion that, while there were many reasons why the refugees left, Israeli military attacks and expulsions were the major ones.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>The Palestinians can be criticized for not having presented detailed proposals at Camp David; but, as has been shown, it would be inaccurate to say they had no positions. It also is true that Barak broke a number of Israeli taboos and moved considerably from prior positions while the Palestinians believed they had made their historic concessions at Oslo, when they agreed to cede 78 percent of mandatory Palestine to Israel; they did not intend the negotiations to further whittle down what they already regarded as a compromise position. But neither the constancy of the Palestinians&amp;#8217; view nor the unprecedented and evolving nature of the Israelis&amp;#8217; ought to have any bearing on the question of whether the Palestinian leadership recognized Israel&amp;#8217;s right to exist as a Jewish state. It is the substance of the Palestinian positions that should count.&amp;#8221;
