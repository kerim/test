      <p>This is an expanded version of an article in Yediot Aharonot, June 30, 2002.</p>

<p>The Gaza strip is a perfect realization of the Israeli vision of</p>

<p>“separation”. Surrounded with electric fences and army posts,</p>

<p>completely sealed off the outside world, Gaza has become a huge</p>

<p>prison. About one third of its land was confiscated for the 7,000</p>

<p>Israeli settlers living there (and their defense array), while over a</p>

<p>million Palestinians are crowded in the remaining areas of the</p>

<p>prison. With no work or sources of income, about 80% of its residents</p>

<p>depend, for their living, on UNRWA, or contributions from Arab states</p>

<p>and charity organizations. Now Israel is considering the</p>

<p>imprisonment there of families of suicide bombers from the West Bank</p>

<p>(1). As a senior Israeli analyst stated, Gaza can now serve as “the</p>

<p>penal colony” of Israel its “devils island, Alcatraz”. (Nahum</p>

<p>Barnea, Yediot Aharonot June 21, 2002).</p>

<p>This is the future that Sharon and the Israeli army designate for</p>

<p>the West Bank as well. While the external fence is presently being</p>

<p>built, Israel’s current military operation is set to be the final</p>

<p>step in the implementation the IDF plans for reestablishing full</p>

<p>military rule (which was abolished in large parts of the West Bank</p>

<p>during the Oslo process). Though Israel describes everything it does</p>

<p>as a spontaneous reaction to terror, the plan was fully spelled out</p>

<p>in the Israeli media already back in March 2001, soon after Sharon</p>

<p>entered office. Alex Fishman, military and strategic analyst of</p>

<p>Yediot Aharonot, explained at the time that since Oslo, “the IDF</p>

<p>regarded the occupied territories as if they were one territorial</p>

<p>cell”, and this placed some constraints on the IDF and enabled a</p>

<p>certain amount of freedom for the PA and the Palestinian population.</p>

<p>The new plan is a return to the concept of the military</p>

<p>administration during the preOslo years: the occupied territories</p>

<p>will be divided into tens of isolated “territorial cells”, each of</p>

<p>which will be assigned a special military force, “and the local</p>

<p>commander will have freedom to use his discretion” as to when and who</p>

<p>to shoot. (Yediot Ahronot weekend supplement, March 9.2001).<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>The first stage of this plan the destruction of the institutions of</p>

<p>the Palestinian Authority was completed in the previous ‘Operation</p>

<p>Defensive Shield’ in April of this year. In practice, from that time</p>

<p>on, the towns and villages of the West Bank have been completely</p>

<p>sealed. Even exit by foot, which was possible up to that point,</p>

<p>became blocked, and movement between the “territorial cells” now</p>

<p>requires formal permits from the Israeli military authorities.</p>

<p>Soldiers and snipers prevent any “unauthorized” walking to</p>

<p>agricultural fields, to places of work and study, or for medical</p>

<p>treatment.</p>

<p>However, unlike the preOslo period of Israeli military rule, the army</p>

<p>makes it clear that there is no intention to construct any civil</p>

<p>administration that will take care of the basic daily needs of the</p>

<p>two million Palestinians, such as food supplies, health services,</p>

<p>garbage and sewage. For these tasks, some form of a Palestinian</p>

<p>Authority will be maintained, though in practice it will not be</p>

<p>allowed to function.</p>

<p>As a ‘military source’ told Ha’aretz, “Internal conclusions of the</p>

<p>security echelons, following operation ‘Defensive Shield’, assessed</p>

<p>that the functioning of the civil branches of the Palestinian</p>

<p>Authority had reached an unprecedented nadir, mainly due to the</p>

<p>destruction the IDF operation left behind in Ramallah (including the</p>

<p>systematic destruction of computers and databases)… Combined with</p>

<p>the severe restrictions on movement, the Palestinian population is</p>

<p>becoming, as the military source defined it, ‘poor, dependent,</p>

<p>unemployed, rather hungry, and extreme’… The financial reserves of</p>

<p>the Palestinian authority are reaching the bottom… In a future not</p>

<p>far off, the majority of Palestinians will only be able to maintain a</p>

<p>reasonable life through the help of international aid.” (Ha’aretz</p>

<p>Hebrew edition, June 23, 2002, Amos Har’el). Thus, the West Bank is</p>

<p>being driven to the level of poverty of the Gaza strip.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the same time that Israel deprives the Palestinians</p>

<p>of their means of income, it also makes a substantial effort to</p>

<p>diminish or block international aid, under the pretext that the aid</p>

<p>is used to support terrorists or their families. At the outset of its</p>

<p>new ‘operation’, Israel “decided to stop the flow of foodaid and</p>

<p>medicine from Iran and Iraq to Palestinians in the territories”</p>

<p>(Ha’aretz, June 24, 2002, Amos Har’el). Iranian and Iraqi aid is an</p>

<p>easy target for Israel, as these countries belong to the “Axis of</p>

<p>Evil”. However, Israel started launching a more ambitious campaign:</p>

<p>The EU the largest PA donor is under constant pressure from Israel</p>

<p>to cut its aid, which is used, inter alia to pay the salaries of</p>

<p>teachers and health workers. The tactics are always the same: Israel</p>

<p>provides some documents presumably linking the PA to terror. Any aid</p>

<p>to the PA is, therefore, aid to terror (2).</p>

<p>UNRWA’s aid is the next target. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for</p>

<p>Palestinians in the Near East (UNRWA) has become a major source of</p>

<p>food for Palestinians in the besieged territories. Its food supplies</p>

<p>are now delivered not only to the refugee camps, but also in towns</p>

<p>and villages. The amount of food UNRWA supplies has increased</p>

<p>fourfold in two years (3). Recently, “Israel has begun a campaign in</p>

<p>the United States and the United Nations to urge a reconsideration of</p>

<p>the way the UN Relief and Works Agency, which runs the Palestinian</p>

<p>refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza, operates. Israel charges</p>

<p>that UNRWA workers simply ignored the fact that Palestinian</p>

<p>organizations were turning the camps into terrorist bases and it is</p>

<p>demanding the agency start reporting all military or terrorist</p>

<p>actions within the camps to the UN…. Meanwhile, Jewish and</p>

<p>proIsraeli lobbyists in the U.S. are waging a parallel campaign …</p>

<p>American Jewish lobbyists are basing their efforts on the fact that</p>

<p>the U.S. currently contributes some 30 percent of UNRWA’s $400</p>

<p>million a year budget, and is therefore in a position to influence</p>

<p>the agency: A congressional refusal to approve UNRWA’s funding could</p>

<p>seriously disrupt its operations. (Ha’aretz June 29, 2002, Nathan</p>

<p>Guttman). The campaign is not yet demanding cutting UNRWA’s aid and</p>

<p>presence altogether, but raising the impossible demand that UNRWA</p>

<p>should serve as an active force in “the war against terror”</p>

<p>(“reporting military or terrorist actions”) is the first step towards</p>

<p>such a demand.(4)</p>

<p>Since September 11, Sharon has been constructing an analogy between</p>

<p>the occupied territories and Afghanistan (with the PA as Al Qaeda).</p>

<p>He keeps declaring that the solution to Palestinian terror, and the</p>

<p>required ‘reforms’, should be along the lines set in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The analogy is frighteningly revealing: As it established the</p>

<p>‘reforms’ in Afghanistan, the US forced starvation upon millions of</p>

<p>people. This is how Noam Chomsky described it: “On Sept. 16, the New</p>

<p>York Times reported that ‘Washington has also demanded [from</p>

<p>Pakistan] a cutoff of fuel supplies…and the elimination of truck</p>

<p>convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to</p>

<p>Afghanistan’s civilian population.’ Astonishingly, that report</p>

<p>elicited no detectable reaction in the West, a grim reminder of the</p>

<p>nature of the Western civilization that leaders and elite</p>

<p>commentators claim to uphold. In the following days, those demands</p>

<p>were implemented… ‘The country was on a lifeline,’ one evacuated</p>

<p>aid worker reports, ‘and we just cut the line’ (NY times Magazine,</p>

<p>September 30). According to the world’s leading newspaper, then,</p>

<p>Washington demanded that Pakistan ensures the death of enormous</p>

<p>numbers of Afghans, millions of them already on the brink of</p>

<p>starvation, by cutting off the limited sustenance that was keeping</p>

<p>them alive.” (Interview with Michael Albert, reprinted in Noam</p>

<p>Chomsky, 911, Seven Stories, 2002). Arundhati Roy, summarized this</p>

<p>at the time: “Witness the infinite justice of the new century.</p>

<p>Civilians starving to death while they’re waiting to be killed”</p>

<p>(Guardian, Sept. 29).</p>

<p>The new stage of Israel’s ‘separation’ can no longer be compared to</p>

<p>the Apartheid of South Africa. As Ronnie Kasrils, South Africa’s</p>

<p>Minister of Water Affairs, said in an Interview with Al Ahram Weekly,</p>

<p>“the South African apartheid regime never engaged in the sort of</p>

<p>repression Israel is inflicting on the Palestinians” (Issue of March</p>

<p>28 April 3, 2002). We are witnessing the daily invisible killing of</p>

<p>the sick and wounded being deprived of medical care, the weak who</p>

<p>cannot survive in the new poverty conditions, and those who are bound</p>

<p>to reach starvation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the public debate in Israel revolves around questions</p>

<p>of efficiency: Is it possible to stop terror in such methods. Let us</p>

<p>suppose even that it is. Is it allowed? Is this what we (Israelis)</p>

<p>want to be?</p>

<p>One people stole the ‘Lamb of its poor neighbor’(5): Gaza and the</p>

<p>West Bank are 22% of the land of Israel- Palestine, where the</p>

<p>Palestinians lived in the past. On this small piece of land, three</p>

<p>million people live, with hopes, needs and dreams, just like ours.</p>

<p>Since Oslo, they have been lured with promises that we are about to</p>

<p>evacuate the settlements and give them back their land, at the very</p>

<p>same time that we have been imprisoning them in Gaza, stealing more</p>

<p>of their land in the West Bank, and leaving them no hope whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Palestinian people are fighting for their freedom. The crimes of</p>

<p>Palestinian terror do not remove our culpability for our own crimes.</p>

<p>Before Oslo, as well, there was a wave of horrible terror attacks.</p>

<p>But at that time, after each such attack, the call was heard get out</p>

<p>of the territories! Then it was still understood that when you leave</p>

<p>people no hope, there is no way to stop the madness of suicide</p>

<p>bombing. It is not too late to get out of the territories.</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>(1) In its meeting on Friday, June 21, 2002, the Israeli cabinet</p>

<p>“decided in principle in favor both of the expulsion of families of</p>

<p>suicide strikers from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip… The</p>

<p>implementation of this expulsion policy depends upon the outcome of a</p>

<p>legal review.” (‘IDF set to expel bombers’ families’ By Aluf Benn,</p>

<p>Amos Harel and Gideon Alon, Ha’aretz June 23, 2002).</p>

<p>(2) Here is one example of the pressure on the EU:</p>

<p>“The documents seized from PA offices in recent months, some</p>

<p>of which were included in the document compiled by minister without</p>

<p>portfolio Dan Naveh following Operation Defensive Shield, were</p>

<p>presented last week to the EC delegation in Israel and</p>

<p>representatives of the International Monetary Fund at a meeting with</p>

<p>IDF intelligence officers. Naveh claims the documents prove European</p>

<p>financial aid has been used to finance terrorism and incitement, and</p>

<p>has also found its way into the pockets of senior PA officials.</p>

<p>The head of the EC’s delegation to Israel, Giancarlo</p>

<p>Chevallard, told Ha’aretz that at the meeting, the delegation saw</p>

<p>evidence that Arafat is financing terrorism, but added Israel had not</p>

<p>provided evidence that European financial aid which is designated to</p>

<p>pay the salaries of PA employees is being used to finance terrorist</p>

<p>attacks. Another senior delegation official said he was extremely</p>

<p>skeptical Israel had evidence to prove European aid is being used by</p>

<p>the PA to finance terrorism…</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the shadow of the Israeli accusations, the</p>

<p>European Parliament’s budgetary committee last week delayed the</p>

<p>transfer of 18.7 million euros in financial aid to the PA until the</p>

<p>EC reports how the money is to be distributed…” (Ha’aretz, June 6,</p>

<p>2002, Yair Ettinger)</p>

<p>This specific frozen amount was released in the meanwhile, however</p>

<p>Israel’s pressure continues.</p>

<p>(3) Amos Har’el, ‘The IDF neutralizes the Palestinian Authority, and</p>

<p>humanitarian organizations try to replace it’, Ha’aretz Hebrew</p>

<p>edition, June 23, 2002. (Quoted before).</p>

<p>(4). The campaign against UNRWA started earlier: “In letters written</p>

<p>to Annan in May, Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter and Democratic</p>

<p>U.S. Representative Tom Lantos accused the U.N. agency of allowing</p>

<p>and promoting terrorist activity in the camps. Specter said UNRWA</p>

<p>schools promoted antiIsraeli and anti Semitic sentiments and Lantos</p>

<p>said the agency allowed terrorists to organize in the camps.”(Inter</p>

<p>Press Service, June 24, 2002)</p>

<p>(5) Bible, Samuel II, 12:11: “12:1The LORD sent Natan to David. He</p>

<p>came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the</p>

<p>one rich, and the other poor. 12:2The rich man had very many flocks</p>

<p>and herds, 12:3but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe</p>

<p>lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him,</p>

<p>and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup,</p>

<p>and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter. 12:4A traveler</p>

<p>came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of</p>

<p>his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but</p>

<p>took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to</p>

<p>him.” (http://ebible.org/bible/hnv/2Sam.htm)</p>
