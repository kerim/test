  <p>“Between August 1 and last night, 49 Palestinians were killed by Israel Defense Forces fire in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; around 180 were injured, with at least 65 of them sustaining wounds from live fire (including shrapnel from shells and missiles). Thirty of those killed were unarmed civilians. Another two Palestinians, both in their 70s, died of injuries sustained in July.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Among those killed during the month were seven children aged 15 and younger (including two girls under the age of 10), and two women from the Gaza Strip &amp;#8211; one aged 50, the other 86.
  
  
  
Ten of the Palestinians killed were wanted men, with eyewitnesses reporting that two of them were killed after surrendering to IDF troops. One of the wanted men was killed when the house in which he was hiding was demolished, and another seven were killed in the framework of Israeli assassination operations. Nine civilians who were in the vicinity of such operations were also killed.&amp;#8221;
