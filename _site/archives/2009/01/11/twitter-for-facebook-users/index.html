      <p>There is no doubt about it, Facebook is a more popular site than <br />
Twitter. And not just by a little bit either. Comparing the two is <br />
like comparing a stadium rock concert with seeing a band at your local <br />
pub:</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_kicking_twitters_ass.php?page=2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_kicking_twitters_ass.php?page=2', 'http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_kicking_twitters_ass.php?page=2']);">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_kicking_twitters_ass.php?page=2</a></p>

<p> “HubSpot estimates that Twitter has 4 to 5 million users, 30% of which <br />
are “brand new or unengaged.” They estimate that Twitter sees between <br />
five and ten thousand new accounts opened each day. That’s a nice <br />
number, but it’s far below, for example, Facebook’s astonishing 600k <br />
daily registrations and 140 million active users. Twitter is a <br />
fascinating little phenomenon – Facebook is mainstream.</p>

<p> Why is this important for users? Because most of the people you might <br />
really enjoy connecting with on Twitter are unlikely to ever use it. <br />
They are busy using Facebook instead.”</p>

<p> So why should Facebook users care about Twitter? Or even bother using <br />
it? We can start by asking why Facebook tried to buy Twitter to the <br />
tune of $500 million in stock, and why Twitter turned down that <br />
seemingly generous offer.</p>

<p> 1. Twitter users are Facebook users already. In some ways Twitter is <br />
just a better way of updating and reading your status updates on <br />
Facebook.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3519812/Why-Facebook-wanted-to-buy-Twitter.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3519812/Why-Facebook-wanted-to-buy-Twitter.html', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3519812/Why-Facebook-wanted-to-buy-Twitter.html']);">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3519812/Why-Facebook-wanted-to-buy-Twitter.html</a></p>

<p> “there is already a closer integration between the two websites than <br />
people are possibly aware of. Facebook’s status updates, one of the <br />
most-loved parts of the site, can be tied to Twitter updates, so that <br />
whenever a Twitter member sends a tweet, it automatically becomes <br />
their status update on Facebook.”</p>

<p> 2. Sure, there are economic reasons why the Twitter folks might have <br />
rejected Facebook. Their service is one of the fastest growing social <br />
networks out there, and at over six million users they are no longer <br />
small fry.</p>

<a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/12/03/why-twitter-didnt-sell-to-facebook-%E2%80%94-really/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gigaom.com/2008/12/03/why-twitter-didnt-sell-to-facebook-%E2%80%94-really/', 'http://gigaom.com/2008/12/03/why-twitter-didnt-sell-to-facebook-%E2%80%94-really/']);">http://gigaom.com/2008/12/03/why-twitter-didnt-sell-to-facebook-%E2%80%94-really/</a></p>

<p> But I think something more fundamental is at work here. Twitter has a <br />
different philosophy than Facebook. What people like about Facebook is <br />
that it creates a private internet where you share things with your <br />
friends – and only with your friends. But that means you spend a lot <br />
of time updating your list of friends, perhaps even marking how they <br />
are related to you. This information about your friendship network is <br />
often referred to as your “social graph” and Facebook guards it <br />
jealously.</p>

<p> <a href="http://dalelarson.com/2008/11/could-twitter-transcendent-clarity-trump-facebook.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dalelarson.com/2008/11/could-twitter-transcendent-clarity-trump-facebook.html', 'http://dalelarson.com/2008/11/could-twitter-transcendent-clarity-trump-facebook.html']);">http://dalelarson.com/2008/11/could-twitter-transcendent-clarity-trump-facebook.html</a></p>

<p> “Social networks like Facebook and Linkedin (and Friendster and <br />
Tribe.net before them) jealously guard their social graph, the <br />
connections between users. So I have to “friend” someone (offering and <br />
accepting) separately for each network I belong to, and I can’t take <br />
advantage of those connections except in software that run on a <br />
particular service. Twitter is different.”</p>

<p> Although new services from Facebook will allow you to use your social <br />
graph with other sites, what makes Twitter different is that (unless <br />
you choose to make your updates private, which you can do) Twitter <br />
allows one-way following. Anyone can follow you, and it is up to you <br />
whether or not you follow them back. I personally follow a little over <br />
half of the people that follow me.</p>

<p> This small difference between how social networks are formed makes a <br />
huge difference in the usefulness of the social network. If I follow <br />
someone on Twitter it isn’t because they are my “friend” it is because <br />
they are good twitterers.</p>

<p> Of course, if I’m close to someone, I’ll be more interested in knowing <br />
what they ate for breakfast this morning.</p>

<p> 3. The openness of Twitter offers a number of advantages. Namely, it <br />
is easy for other people to build services on top of twitter. Sure, <br />
there are Facebook Apps. I was excited about the Facebook platform <br />
when it first came out but most of the apps seem designed to annoy <br />
your friends by making them take movie polls or the like. Twitter on <br />
the other hand allows me to do things like search all posts (“tweets”) <br />
by all users in real time. Not exciting normally, but suddenly useful <br />
during major events, whether it is the presidential debates, the <br />
Mumbai attacks, the war in Gaza, or an earthquake, etc.</p>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/world/asia/30twitter.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/world/asia/30twitter.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/world/asia/30twitter.html']);">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/world/asia/30twitter.html</a></p>

<p> Just take a look at Twitter Vision which shows the main twitter stream <br />
on a map. This is a great example of something you can’t do on <br />
Facebook because of its closed nature:</p>

<p> <a href="http://twittervision.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twittervision.com/', 'http://twittervision.com/']);">http://twittervision.com/</a></p>

<p> Many of these tools also make it easier to update and follow twitter <br />
wherever you are. My favorite apps right now are “tweetie” on the <br />
iPhone and EventBox on the Mac. The cross-platform client, “twhirl” is <br />
also good.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/', 'http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/']);">http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/</a> <br />
<a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thecosmicmachine.com/', 'http://thecosmicmachine.com/']);">http://thecosmicmachine.com/</a> <br />
<a href="http://www.twhirl.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.twhirl.org/', 'http://www.twhirl.org/']);">http://www.twhirl.org/</a></p>

<p> And if you live in the US or India you can tweet via SMS, which I <br />
think is one of the main reasons for Twitter’s success.</p>

<p> 4. Finally, I think a word needs to be said about one of the key <br />
features of Twitter – one that Shashwati mentioned when I asked her <br />
why she likes Twitter better than Facebook: its simplicity.</p>

<p> Web guru Tim O’Reilly agrees:</p>

<p> <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/why-i-like-twitter.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/why-i-like-twitter.html', 'http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/why-i-like-twitter.html']);">http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/why-i-like-twitter.html</a></p>

<p> “Twitter does one small thing, and does it well.”</p>

<p> This in turn leads to some interesting innovations, fads, and user behaviors:</p>

<p> “Perhaps because its features are so minimal, new user behaviors seem <br />
to propagate across Twitter really quickly. It’s a bit like the reason <br />
that fruit flies are used for genetic research: the short lifespan <br />
compresses the time for mutations to take hold. Perhaps a better <br />
analogy would be the speed of cultural evolution among humans compared <br />
to biological evolution. The most fascinating evolution happening on <br />
Twitter isn’t an evolution of the software, but an evolution in user <br />
behavior and in the types of data that are being shared. ”</p>

<p> In the end, I don’t think Twitter will replace Facebook. There is a <br />
place for catching up with old high school buddies and acquaintances <br />
and sharing baby photos, etc. And if you Twitter you can easily share <br />
your Twitter updates with those people on Facebook. But Twitter is a <br />
conversation; a conversation where you can choose who you want to <br />
listen to, and you can jump in (or drop out) at any time. I like that.</p>
