      <p>The vast majority of the world is multilingual. Not only are they <br />
multilingual, but many people use multiple scripts as well, including <br />
character based scripts like Chinese and right-to-left scripts like <br />
Hebrew and Arabic. In the old days of computing each of these various <br />
scripts was handled differently, with each computer platform using <br />
various different ways of implementing each script. This meant that <br />
one had to choose your default script (i.e. Traditional Chinese) and <br />
stick with that. It was difficult to mix and match scripts, and if you <br />
were using a computer which wasn’t set for that script as your default <br />
you had to know which script a website was encoded in before you could <br />
read it properly. In short, it was a pain in the ass to be <br />
multilingual on the internet.</p>

<p> All that changed with the development of “unicode” a standard which <br />
allows (almost) all scripts to peacefully coexist. And most websites <br />
have adopted this new standard. But many have not. In Taiwan, for <br />
instance, many sites still expect your browser to be set for <br />
Traditional Chinese in order to work properly. Some sites (like the <br />
site I have to use to enter grades at my university) won’t even work <br />
unless you are using a Traditional Chinese version of Internet <br />
Explorer running on a Traditional Chinese version of Windows. Ugh! <br />
Other sites are botched because they use Adobe Flash which doesn’t yet <br />
accept unicode input methods on OS X. And still other sites, like <br />
Soup.io, are botched because they strip all unicode data when doing <br />
something as simple as uploading files. One reason I love my iPhone so <br />
much is because Palm never introduced unicode support on its PalmOS. <br />
Fortunately its new WebOS is built on WebKit, which has unicode <br />
support built in. Things are getting better, but there is still a long <br />
way to go.</p>

<p> But the biggest hurdle is in the mentality of web designers. I often <br />
write to complain that some site or another falls short in its support <br />
for international text. Not just to complain, but because I like the <br />
site but can’t use it because it won’t accept Chinese language file <br />
names, book titles, contact information, or some other international <br />
text I need in order to do my work here in Taiwan. What drives me <br />
crazy is when, in response to such an e-mail, I get a blanket response <br />
telling me that the developers are working on a Chinese version of <br />
their website. This is *not* what I want. Localization means that all <br />
the menus, help text, etc. are translated into Chinese. This is great <br />
for people whose English is less than fluent, but even many of my <br />
Taiwanese colleagues here in Taiwan prefer to use websites in English. <br />
What they want is to use Chinese data! Support for international <br />
scripts is not the same thing as localization.</p>

<p> I think the problem is that these web designers assume a one-to-one <br />
correspondence between users and languages. If you are Taiwanese you <br />
want to use their site in Chinese. Google assumes this every time I <br />
log in to their mobile website from my iPhone. This is even worse <br />
because it assumes I am Taiwanese simply because I am logging in from <br />
Taiwan. Not everyone in Taiwan is Taiwanese. At least on the iPhone <br />
they have a button to access the site in English – but on some of <br />
their websites, like Youtube, it seems impossible to figure out how to <br />
get the site in English (it is easier from some other language sites, <br />
but the Taiwan website makes it very difficult). Even worse, if you <br />
want to change the default language of the main Google homepage, the <br />
list of languages appears in Chinese – which not everyone using the <br />
website in Taiwan can read. Would you know to click on 英文 to get <br />
English?</p>

<p> Web designers need to put more thought into the fact that users might <br />
be non-native speakers in the country in which they reside. Spanish <br />
speakers in the US might want a Spanish interface, and English <br />
speakers in China might want an English interface. They also need to <br />
understand that people who speak one language might need to use and <br />
access data in other scripts. Many Taiwanese websites have an “English <br />
language” version which is devoid of most of the data on the Chinese <br />
version, and is rarely updated. Even worse, important information, <br />
like a business address, are presented entirely in Latin text. Even <br />
non-native speakers who can’t read Chinese often need to have the <br />
Chinese characters for a name or address since most locals can’t read <br />
the romanized version of their language. The solution is to not <br />
ghettoize the English version of the website, but to present the two <br />
languages side-by-side.</p>

<p> The internet is multilingual in that there are many different <br />
languages spoken on the web, but very few websites have really thought <br />
through the needs of multilingual users. Understanding the problem is <br />
the first step.</p>
