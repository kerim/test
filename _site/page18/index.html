Former Clinton White House adviser and prominent blogger, Brad DeLong says: “We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to revive our economy, or do we want to punish the bankers?” But critics of the Geithner plan are not saying he&#8217;s being too soft on the bankers because they want to see blood. They are saying ...</p>

  <p>When I was about eight years old I used to play with the mainframe computer at my dad's engineering school. I still remember playing Star Trek. Then, as I went through school, it seemed computer technology jumped ahead from year to year, from the TRS-80s in 5th grade, to the Apple IIs in middle school, till one day, at a computer fair I attended...</p>

  </h2>
  <p>Mother Jones reports that the average American household spends about $500 per year on lottery tickets &#8211; more than on movies, books, and music combined. 

So my idea to save newspapers is to print them on lottery tickets! Or, more precisely, make each page of the newspaper a lottery ticket by printing a number on it. If you get an annual s...</p>

  <p>When I look up a word I need for a lecture on political-economy or colonial theory, I know I will not find the word I need in my dictionary.

  <p>I want to use Zotero 1.5b, but it seems that Firefox 3.0 has problems with large databases, and I have over 4000 references. So I&#8217;m going to try upgrading to Firefox 3.1b just to see if things work. In preparation I&#8217;m backing up my extensions. For future reference here&#8217;s what I have installed.
