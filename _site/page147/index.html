  <p>My dad has a letter to the editor in today’s times, placing Afghanistan’s elections in a historical context:


  To the Editor:

  It is important to put the presidential elections in Afghanistan into historical perspective.

  <p>My favorite quote from last night&#8217;s debate:

> The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn&#8217;t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective....</p>

  <p>*Newsweek* has a story about Paul Bremer. It goes beyond his widely reported remarks regarding not having enough troops to discuss what many think was one of the most serious errors of the war: the decision to disbanded the army, driving many former soldiers into the opposition. A conversation supposedly took place between Bremer and his predece...</p>

  <p>CMS stands for &#8220;Content Management System&#8221; and refers to software which makes it easy to update and maintain a website. The content is usually stored in an online database, separate from the code which displays that content on your screen.

  <p>Cheney tried to spin elections in Iraq by comparing them to those he had observed in El Salvador:

  <p>The &#8220;is Bush wired?&#8221; story is getting more and more coverage. Salon has a story today. Much has been made of the fact that the debate rules were intended to prevent any pictures of the candidates from the back; however, nobody has mentioned this other curious rule:

  <p>This is the most scathing inditement I have seen of the Republican Party &#8211; and it is entirely constructed out of their own words. Using video footage from the Republican Convention, someone has wonderfully cut together all of the instances of words like &#8220;September 11th,&#8221; &#8220;Saddam,&#8221; and &#8220;Terrorists&#8221; used b...</p>
