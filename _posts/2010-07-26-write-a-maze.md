Early on in the summer blockbuster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_(film)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_(film)', 'Inception']);" >Inception</a> the main character, Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is looking to hire a dream &#8220;architect&#8221; and he gives Ariadne (Ellen Page) a test: Can she create, in less than 60 seconds, a two-dimensional maze which takes more than 60 seconds to solve? I feel this scene perfectly captures the spirit of the screenplay which Christopher Nolan has supposedly been working on since he was 16 years old. The film is basically a thriller, an action film, albiet one with a few more plot twists than spoon-fed modern audiences are used to. What makes it special is that, for most viewers (including myself) sorting out all the twists and turns of the plot takes a little longer than the 148 minutes it takes to watch the film. It is a film that keeps you thinking after you leave the theater, but not for much longer than that. By the time you&#8217;ve finished your after-movie dinner all the pieces have fallen into place and you can forget the film much as you would forget any summer blockbuster.

I don&#8217;t say this to dismiss the film, which I would gladly watch again in sheer admiration for the story-making craft exhibited by the writer-director, but because I think it explains the confusion critics have faced in trying to determine where the film stands in the pantheon. AO Scott tries to be cute by splitting the difference: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/movies/25scott.html?ref=movies" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/movies/25scott.html?ref=movies', 'saying']);" >saying</a> the film &#8220;was totally overrated. Unless it was a masterpiece.&#8221; (AO Scott always seems more concerned about having the &#8220;right&#8221; opinion on a film than actually trying to say anything interesting about the film.) The problem is that this film doesn&#8217;t aim for greatness &#8211; it just aims to be good enough to keep you glued to your seat for 148 minutes, and maybe a little more than that. 

Just for succeeding at its self-assigned task, the film deserves to be called a masterpiece &#8211; especially when compared to similar films in the genre: Shutter Island, Fight Club, Dark City, the Matrix, etc. Most of these films let you out of the maze a little too early, and then bore you with some overwrought final dialog (The Matrix), or end with a boring, but predictable feat of heroism (The Matrix), or both (The Matrix). Inception could arguably be accused of all these things as well, but you probably won&#8217;t notice till after your 148 minutes are up.
