Made me think of this quote by Lord Acton:

> The monarchy which had been engaged from the 13th century in curbing the nobles, was at last thrust aside by the democracy, because it was too dilatory in the work, and was unable to deny its own origin and effectually ruin the class from which it sprang. . . . **The substance of the ideas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution', '1789']);" >1789</a> is not the limitation of the soverign power, but the abrogation of intermediate powers.** 

From Lord Acton, &#8220;Nationality&#8221;, <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/ab/b-titles/balakrishnan_map_nation.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.versobooks.com/books/ab/b-titles/balakrishnan_map_nation.shtml', 'Mapping the Nation']);" ><em>Mapping the Nation</em></a>, p. 24. (Emphasis added.)

UPDATE: Added link to the date in the quote.
