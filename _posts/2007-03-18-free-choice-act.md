The Employee Free Choice Act passed the house vote, now it is going to the senate. If you are a US citizen, <a href="http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/Support_EFCA" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/Support_EFCA', 'please go here']);" >please go here</a> to tell your senator that they should pass this important bill!

Why is this important? The standard method (NLRB elections by secret ballot) are much <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/10/post_1713.html#014061" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/10/post_1713.html#014061', 'more prone to coercion']);" >more prone to coercion</a> by management:

> Today, 60 million workers in America want to join unions. But employers routinely block their efforts—and our laws are too weak to protect them. It&#8217;s time for Congress to support the Employee Free Choice Act, which would allow workers to make their own uncoerced decisions on whether or not to form a union. Please sign the following petition urging members of Congress to support this important legislation.
