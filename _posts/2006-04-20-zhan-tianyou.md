The other day I was giving a talk in which I was discussing David Byrne&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt1.html', 'defense of Powerpoint']);" >defense of Powerpoint</a> during which I said to my students: &#8220;You know, the lead singer of Talking Heads.&#8221; As I looked at their blank faces I realized there was no way I could expect them to know of the band Talking Heads. Celine Dion they know, but Talking Heads is another story. (Although, were I given the choice, I personally would much rather listen to a butchered version of &#8220;Psycho Killer&#8221; than a perfect rendition of &#8220;Power of Love&#8221; the next time I&#8217;m dragged to a KTV.)

But today the tables were turned. Ms. Lin at the library referred me to Ms. Zhan. When I asked the name again, to be sure I had it right, she replied: &#8220;Zhan. You know, like Zhan Tianyou.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know, but as soon as I was done I ran up to my office and looked it up in Wikipedia.

> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhan_Tianyou" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhan_Tianyou', 'Zhan Tianyou']);" >Zhan Tianyou</a> (April 26, 1861 – April 24, 1919) (Traditional Chinese: 詹天佑; Simplified Chinese: 詹天佑; pinyin: Zhān Tiānyòu) was a distinguised Chinese railroad engineer. He was educated in the United States of America and was the Chief Engineer responsible for construction of the Imperial Peking-Kalgan Railway, the first railway constructed in China without foreign assistance.

Of course, how could I have not known! But then I didn&#8217;t go to school in Taiwan under the KMT where everyone used to be tested on the location of every railway station in China&#8230;

Thank god for Wikipedia!
