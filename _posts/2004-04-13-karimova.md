This story is impossible to summarize. You really have to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6874-2004Apr12?language=printer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6874-2004Apr12?language=printer', 'read the whole thing']);" >read the whole thing</a>. It reads like a soap opera written jointly by Salman Rushdie and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Here is a teaser:

> It turns out that divorcing Gulnora Karimova, known as &#8220;the Uzbek princess,&#8221; is no simple matter. Her father is Islam Karimov, president of Uzbekistan and autocrat nonpareil, who rules over a repressive Central Asian country where prisoners have been boiled alive. He also happens to be a key ally in America&#8217;s war on terrorism.
