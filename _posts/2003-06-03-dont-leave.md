Fareed Zakaria has <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/917901.asp#BODY" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/917901.asp#BODY', 'some advice']);" >some advice</a> for the administration: Stick around and make sure those countries are rebuilt! I was against both wars, but I agree &#8211; if anything good is to be salvaged from these foolhardy adventures, we must stick around for a long time to make good on our promise of a better life!


>   Yes, Bosnia and Kosovo are not functioning liberal democracies with market economies. But they are a whole lot better off than they were, and than most poor and ethnically riven countries. If the base line is Germany and Japan&#8212;ethnically homogenous countries that had advanced economies before World War II&#8212;they have fallen short. If the base line is Somalia, they have done pretty well.<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The key lesson of nation-building over the past decade is, don&#8217;t leave. In Haiti and Somalia, we left. In Bosnia and Kosovo, we&#8217;re still there. The corollary: keep sufficient force to maintain order. In Somalia and Haiti, the forces were too thin and too soon withdrawn; in Bosnia and Kosovo, large troop deployments remain for the long term.

But while we are there, we must work towards creating <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002895.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002895.html', 'real democracy']);" >real democracy</a>!
