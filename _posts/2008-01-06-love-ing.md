Over at Pinyin.info Mark Swofford notices a new trend of <a href="http://pinyin.info/news/2008/mandarin-borrow-ing-english-grammatical-forms/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pinyin.info/news/2008/mandarin-borrow-ing-english-grammatical-forms/', 'inserting &#8220;ING&#8221;']);" >inserting &#8220;ING&#8221;</a> at the end of Chinese verbs. When I twittered about this, Zonble pointed me to the above song by MayDay, the title of which is 戀愛ing (Lianai &#8211; ING), meaning &#8220;loving&#8221; or &#8220;romancing.&#8221; Interestingly, if you listen to the song they don&#8217;t pronounce it the way I thought they would. Instead of saying &#8220;ing&#8221; as in English, they spell out the letters. I suppose that reflects the derivation of this practice from the written form in online chatrooms and the like.

UPDATE: Also see this 1994 study on the &#8220;<a href="http://pinyin.info/news/2007/assimilation-of-roman-letters-into-the-chinese-writing-system-1994-study/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pinyin.info/news/2007/assimilation-of-roman-letters-into-the-chinese-writing-system-1994-study/', 'Assimilation of Roman letters into the Chinese writing system']);" >Assimilation of Roman letters into the Chinese writing system</a>.&#8221;
