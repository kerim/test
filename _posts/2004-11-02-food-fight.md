Sorry, with my thesis due so soon I&#8217;ve been negligent on covering the connection between food and politics in Taiwan. But how could I have missed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3954847.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3954847.stm', 'this story']);" >this story</a>!?

> One minute they were sitting in a conference hall having lunch, engaged in a strongly worded discussion about international arms sales.
> 
> The next minute it was the lunch that was doing the talking, as the island&#8217;s lawmakers hurled rice, meat, vegetables and even hard-boiled eggs across the room.
> 
> According to the Associated Press news agency, a local TV crew caught the incident on camera, but said it was difficult to tell who had started the food fight.
> 
> Opposition member Chu Fong-chi was filmed shouting at ruling party delegates, and then ducking to avoid something being thrown in her direction.
> 
> She quickly responded, picking up a cardboard lunch box and throwing it at another legislator, Chen Chong-yi.
> 
> Mr Chen gave as good as he got, leaving Ms Chu with what appeared to be food stains on the back of her blouse.
> 
> &#8220;My whole body smells like a lunch box!&#8221; she is said to have yelled.
> 
> The ministerial food fight was all over in minutes, with the only evidence being a few pieces of egg and fistfuls of rice in various corners of the otherwise austere conference hall.
