Attacks by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates on the GNU General Public License, under which much open source and free software is distributed, have been driven by a fear that the GPL creates a domain of software that Microsoft cannot privatize and control, according to GPL founder Richard Stallman. &#8230; Using some of his strongest language yet in his campaign against open source and free software, Gates equated the concepts to anti-capitalism.
