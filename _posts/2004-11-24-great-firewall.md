Dan Gillmor has an interesting piece on <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/011043.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/011043.shtml', 'blogging in China']);" >blogging in China</a>.

> Blogging isn&#8217;t big business here, at least not yet. At least three blog software providers and Internet hosting operations serve the Chinese-language market, along with several U.S. companies that have created local language versions.

One vital improvement, he says, will be blogging software that lets people make postings visible only to a selected audience, not to society (and government monitors) at large.
