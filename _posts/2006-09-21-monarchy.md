Thaksin Shinawatra was a brutal man whose own commitment to democracy was less than stellar (to say the least), but that doesn&#8217;t really explain what happened in Thailand. Unfortunately, reporters haven&#8217;t bothered to interview anyone other than members of the Bangkok middle classes who wanted Thaksin out. We are regularly assured that democracy will be restored, but nobody asks why a government elected by a popular vote in a free and fair election needed to be removed by force shortly before the next election?

Fortunately Kotaji has done some investigation and <a href="http://kotaji.blogsome.com/2006/09/20/communication-from-thailand/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kotaji.blogsome.com/2006/09/20/communication-from-thailand/', 'rounded up']);" >rounded up</a> some useful articles for us. The three most salient points seem to be as follows:

First, Thaksin&#8217;s populist economic policies angered neoliberals. Second, his recent move towards <a href="http://leninology.blogspot.com/2006/09/coup-in-thailand.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://leninology.blogspot.com/2006/09/coup-in-thailand.html', 'negotiation']);" >negotiation</a> with the Muslims in the South (possibly resulting in greater regional autonomy) angered the king. And third, attempts to <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HI21Ae02.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HI21Ae02.html', 'consolidate power']);" >consolidate power</a> before the next election by sidelining some of the king&#8217;s men clearly provoked a reaction.

Even where I don&#8217;t personally like a ruler, I find attempts to subvert democratic processes &#8211; processes which I think are far more fragile than most people think &#8211; deeply troubling. Nearly eight hundred years after the signing of the Magna Carta, people still seem <a href="http://www.monarchy.net/quotations.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.monarchy.net/quotations.htm', 'enthralled by monarchy']);" >enthralled by monarchy</a>&#8230;
