It is so &#8220;right-on&#8221; that I just have to quote a large chunk of it here:


>   The subject comes to mind when &#8220;leaders&#8221; say: &#8220;I&#8217;m a fiscal conservative but a social liberal.&#8221; The only way that shibboleth makes any sense at all is if you define &#8220;social&#8221; as abortion, gun control, and prayer in schools. But we used to define &#8220;social&#8221; as the problems of our society&#8211;poverty, hunger, illiteracy, homelessness, joblessness, the lonely aged, and on and on. If you use the word &#8220;social&#8221; in this sense, the sense in which it traditionally is used, you cannot be &#8220;a fiscal conservative and a social liberal&#8221; for the very obvious reason that it costs some money to help those in need.
