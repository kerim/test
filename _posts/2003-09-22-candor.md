Why was there an &#8220;<a href="http://216.239.33.104/search?q=cache:nWEE4O5qUuMJ:www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/bookman/+%22Now+where+would+they+get+an+idea+like+that%3F%22++Bookman&#38;hl=en&#38;ie=UTF-8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://216.239.33.104/search?q=cache:nWEE4O5qUuMJ:www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/bookman/+%22Now+where+would+they+get+an+idea+like+that%3F%22++Bookman&hl=en&ie=UTF-8', 'outbreak of candor']);" >outbreak of candor</a>&#8221; by Bush and his top aids, in which they denied any link between Sadaam Hussein and the September 11th attack?


>   The outbreak of candor among Bush and his top aides was made necessary by statements from Vice President Dick Cheney in a Sept. 14 appearance on &#8220;Meet the Press.&#8221; Cheney went seriously off-script in that interview, suggesting not only that Saddam might have been behind the attacks of Sept. 11, but also implying that Saddam sponsored the original attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.


And where did Cheney get the idea that &#8220;Saddam sponsored the original attack on the World Trade Center in 1993&#8243;?


>   The charge of Saddam&#8217;s involvement in the &#8217;93 bombing was originated by Laurie Mylroie, an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.


But there is one problem:


>   Mylroie&#8217;s explanation has found no support in the intelligence community, and in 2001, her credibility was strained further when she publicly suggested that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing, might have been dupes acting at Saddam&#8217;s behest. She also alleged that evidence of such a connection to Saddam had been suppressed for political reasons by President Clinton.
