This columnist in the Wall Street Journal believes that &#8220;double taxation&#8221; is a serious concern &#8211; for the very same reasons listed in the CBPP article that dismisses them: because corporations don&#8217;t pay these taxes. He argues that the process by which corporations avoid payment leads to bad buisness practices that an elimination of the taxes could avoid; but, and here is the kicker, only if the taxes were eliminated for corporations &#8211; not for individuals! So while reform might arguably be needed, it isn&#8217;t being gone about in a way that actually adresses the problem!!!

He argues that if corporations didn&#8217;t pay taxes they would pay out more in dividends to investors, which would even help 401K investors. I personally don&#8217;t really understand any of this, and I may have mischaracterized his argument, but it is interesting to see The American Prospect and the Wall Street Journal in agreement, even if they don&#8217;t acknowledge their common ground. Kuttner doesn&#8217;t acknowledge the need for reform, and the Wall Street Journal doesn&#8217;t seem to think that it is odd that double taxation of Payroll is not an issue, but dividends is.


>   &#8220;Under the proposal unveiled Tuesday by President Bush, individuals won&#8217;t be taxed on the dividends they receive. That might seem like a clever way of pressuring companies into paying higher dividends.
