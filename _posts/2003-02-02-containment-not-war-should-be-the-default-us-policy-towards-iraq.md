For anyone who missed it, the NY Times has a must-read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/opinion/02MEAR.html?pagewanted=print&position=top" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/opinion/02MEAR.html?pagewanted=print&position=top', 'op-ed article']);" >op-ed article</a> on containment as an option to war. For all those who say that the anti-war movement must offer alternatives, this article shows that it is, in fact, the war hawks who must defend their policies and that containment should be the **default** policy! 


>   The United States faces a clear choice on Iraq: containment or preventive war. President Bush insists that containment has failed and we must prepare for war. In fact, war is not necessary. Containment has worked in the past and can work in the future, even when dealing with Saddam Hussein.
