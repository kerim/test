One of my former professors is involved in the <a href="http://www.thoreaugroup.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thoreaugroup.org/', 'following organization']);" >following organization</a>, which is unique in that it bypasses most of the usual NGOs, getting the money directly to 20-30 families.

> The Thoreau Group is a non-profit organization dedicated to development and disaster relief. It is currently raising funds to help the Tsunami victims of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. These islands are located off the Southern coast of India and lie in close proximity to the epicenter of the Tsunami. The tribes that live there have little contact with the outside world, and the Indian Navy reports that they may have lost 20 to 30 percent of their populations. Some of the smaller tribes may have only a few survivors or may even have been wiped out entirely.
> 
> This organization was founded after the earthquake in Gujarat, India in 2001. At that time, a number of desert village populations were entirely overlooked because cameras and the press never got there. We fear that the tribes on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands may be enduring a similar fate at this time. In response to the 2001 earthquake, we were able to identify villages in need and provide direct assistance to those populations. We request your financial assistance in helping us provide aid to the survivors of the recent disaster.
