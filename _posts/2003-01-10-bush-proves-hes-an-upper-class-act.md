Robert Reich, former secretary of labor, argues that the problem with the economy is that increasing inequality is making the masses increasingly unable to consume &#8211; so tax cuts for the rich won&#8217;t help. There isn&#8217;t a need for more corporate investment because we have a **surplus** of production power that isn&#8217;t being used! Will the democrats become the party of sound economic planning and fiscal responsibility? They have an opportunity to do so in the face of Bush&#8217;s economic recklessness.


>   &#8220;But here&#8217;s the rub. All the goods and services that can now be produced have to be bought by someone. Individual consumers account for two-thirds of what&#8217;s purchased in the nation. And because of the productivity revolution, a lot of items can be made cheaper. But they&#8217;re not so cheap that consumers can afford to buy all of them on paychecks that haven&#8217;t gone anywhere.

But they spend only a fraction of the money they have. The much-larger anxious class doesn&#8217;t have a lot of discretionary income after paying for utilities, food and housing. The underclass has virtually none.&#8221;
