Frankly, I&#8217;ve been quite shocked at the number of male bloggers who seem to feel that rape is justified if some certain &#8220;point&#8221; has passed in a sexual encounter. So I was happy to see <a href="http://slate.msn.com//?id=2089687&#38;" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com//?id=2089687&', 'this quote']);" >this quote</a>, which I think made the issue about as clear as it can be:


>   The notion that men are hard-wired to dominate and overcome ambivalent women stopped being cute about 10,000 years ago.

>   
>     Is sexual conversation confusing? Yes? Is it frustrating? Maybe. Should we change laws because women are conflicted and men are horny? No.
