Big surprise: Turns out Republicans are not the champions of &#8220;states rights&#8221; they claim to be. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002898.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002898.html', 'Daily Kos']);" >Daily Kos</a> quotes a <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/000961.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/000961.shtml', 'Nathan Newman']);" >Nathan Newman</a> post about how Republicans are challenging a California Law which prevents companies from diverting state funds for anti-union campaigns. And over at <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003318.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003318.html', 'Talk Left']);" >Talk Left</a> there is an article about how the Republicans have moved more crimes under federal law rather than state law. Talk Left also points out the origin of the term as a way of protecting slavery in the South. It should be added that Strom Thurmand ran on a &#8220;States Rights&#8221; platform which, at the time, was understood to mean the protection of Jim Crow in the South! Also, don&#8217;t forget that the Renquist Supreme Court overruled Florida on the whole election recount issue!
