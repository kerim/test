CMS stands for &#8220;<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system', 'Content Management System']);" >Content Management System</a>&#8221; and refers to software which makes it easy to update and maintain a website. The content is usually stored in an online database, separate from the code which displays that content on your screen. This makes it easy to change the content, or add new content, without having to worry about the code. Similarly, you can quickly change the code to affect the display of your entire site without having to worry about the content. But there are many different types of CMS, so which one is right for you?

This is a question I get asked a lot these days, so I&#8217;ve written a handy guide on my wiki, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Choosing_The_Right_CMS" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Choosing_The_Right_CMS', 'Choosing the Right CMS']);" >Choosing the Right CMS</a>.&#8221; It is intended to help people sort out the difference between blogs, wikis, forums, and news portals, as well as point them to good open source tools for each category. Feel free to contribute to the article!
