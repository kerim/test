I was reading <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2003/08/thrupkaew-n-08-04.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2003/08/thrupkaew-n-08-04.html', 'Noy  Thrupkaew&#8217;s discussion of recent Gay-themed TV shows']);" >Noy Thrupkaew&#8217;s discussion of recent Gay-themed TV shows</a> in The American Prospect, when this caught my eye [my emphasis]:


>   Indeed, the presence of a straight man seems to offer an excuse for heterosexual viewers to test out their &#8220;gaydar,&#8221; their ability to discern queer from straight. The producers flatter themselves in the show&#8217;s intro by touting Boy as an edifying show that creates &#8220;a world where gay is the norm and straight men must stay in the closet. . . . Will boundaries be crossed? Can stereotypes be shattered?&#8221; As if the show&#8217;s contrivances can undo power dynamics and norms in an instant, or become anything more than a crass guessing game &#8212; one that &#8220;trivializes what gays and lesbians are forced to go through every day,&#8221; one of my friends recently remarked. &#8220;<b>In 36 states in this country,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it&#8217;s legal to fire someone based on his or her sexual orientation.</b> On this show, role-playing is done for &#8216;fun&#8217; or for a cash prize &#8212; the opposite of what a community has to do to even survive, to avoid the risk of being fired or even gay bashed.&#8221;


Could that be, I thought? A Google search showed it to indeed be true. I think it is slightly more accurate to state that in 36 states it is &#8220;not illegal&#8221; since what he really means is that <a href="http://www.hrc.org/issues/workplace/quickfacts.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hrc.org/issues/workplace/quickfacts.asp', 'only 14 states &#8220;have laws that prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.&#8221;']);" >only 14 states &#8220;have laws that prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.&#8221;</a> But that is just nitpicking, it is still quite shocking.

While very few states have such laws, <a href="http://www.hrc.org/worknet/asp_search/results.asp?sKey=List&#38;List=IVb&#38;t=ND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hrc.org/worknet/asp_search/results.asp?sKey=List&List=IVb&t=ND', '280 cities and municipalities']);" >280 cities and municipalities</a> have enacted their own nondiscrimination laws. So while Texas doesn&#8217;t have such a law, <a href="http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/060102/bus_abj060102-12.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/060102/bus_abj060102-12.shtml', 'Dallas does']);" >Dallas does</a>. Hopefully the cost of keeping track of every local law will encourage larger corporations to have nondiscrimination policies (<a href="http://www.hrc.org/worknet/asp_search/results.asp?sKey=List&#38;List=I&#38;t=ND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hrc.org/worknet/asp_search/results.asp?sKey=List&List=I&t=ND', '322 Fortune 500 companies have such policies']);" >322 Fortune 500 companies have such policies</a>). Still, we have a long way to go as a society if it is OK to fire someone for being gay in most of the country.
