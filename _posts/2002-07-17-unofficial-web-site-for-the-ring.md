Released in early 1998 and made for a mere 1.2 million dollars, the Ring was the number 1 box office sensation of the year, smashing records in Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It has been screened at international film festivals in the U.S. and abroad, winning awards in Brussels, Puchon, and New Zealand to name a few. As of this writing it remains commercially unavailable in the United States, though an American remake is in the final stages of post-production.

Warning: There are some &#8220;spoilers&#8221; on the site so don&#8217;t read everything if you haven&#8217;t seen the movie. You can get the movie as a VCD from Videomas.com. It is in Japanese with Chinese subtitles, but that doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to have subtitles. And besides, you can print out the full screenplay from this web site!
