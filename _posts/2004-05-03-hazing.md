At the end of my last post on the photos from <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000545.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000545.html', 'Abu Ghraib']);" >Abu Ghraib</a>, I quoted President Bush as saying:

> &#8220;That&#8217;s not the way we do things in America.&#8221;

And asserted that this was not true, linking to an article about <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/military/031103airforce.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.now.org/issues/military/031103airforce.html', 'rape in the Air Force Academy']);" >rape in the Air Force Academy</a>.

Well, I think <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200405030010" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mediamatters.org/items/200405030010', 'the following']);" >the following</a> makes my point even better:

> On the April 30 broadcast of FOX News Channel&#8217;s *Hannity & Colmes*, former U.S. Army sergeant and former interrogation instructor Tony Robinson stated that &#8220;frat hazing is worse&#8221; than &#8220;what [was] happening in these pictures&#8221;

Indeed. I think the point of the above post is to imply that this is an inaccurate depiction of obvious torture; but, suppose he is right? This says something serious about the culture of masculinity in to which many of our nation&#8217;s students are indoctrinated.

In this vein it is also worth talking about the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0122-10.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0122-10.htm', 'Skull and Bones Society']);" >Skull and Bones Society</a> at Yale. Both Bush and Kerry were members. We all know what the *secret* is in &#8220;secret society,&#8221; don&#8217;t we?
