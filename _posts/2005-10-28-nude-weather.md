My brother, upon reading about my idea for <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/10/26/yesterdays-weather/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/10/26/yesterdays-weather/', 'comparative weather reports']);" >comparative weather reports</a>, reminded me of another innovative weather reporting phenomenon: nude weather reports! This was a concept originally developed by Czech TV station <a href="http://www.nova.cz/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nova.cz/', 'TV Nova']);" >TV Nova</a>. Here is how Brad Freden described it to <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/dave/barry061999.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jewishworldreview.com/dave/barry061999.asp', 'David Barry']);" >David Barry</a>:

> At 11 p.m. every night a buxom woman or (more recently) a muscular young man goes on camera stark naked. He or she then does a reverse strip tease as the announcer reads the weather forecast. The amount and type of clothes he/she puts on depends on the forecast.

I was wondering why nobody has yet copied this in the US, but then I remembered that Americans have always preferred violence to sex. And personally, I&#8217;d rather see<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9803871/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9803871/', 'Al Roker nocked over']);" >Al Roker nocked over</a> than naked.
