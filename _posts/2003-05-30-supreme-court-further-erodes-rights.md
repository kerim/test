And, according to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, there is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la%2Ded%2Dmiranda28may28&#38;section=/printstory" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la%2Ded%2Dmiranda28may28&section=/printstory', 'nothing wrong']);" >nothing wrong</a> with that! Why? Because the evidence would have been inadmissible! Why would the evidence have been inadmissible? Because he had not been advised of his rights. So it is OK to not advise someone of their rights and to torture them &#8211; as long as you don&#8217;t try to prosecute them on the basis of evidence you collect that way&#8230;

Much more about this over at <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003254.html#003254" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003254.html#003254', 'Talk Left']);" >Talk Left</a>. Seems like there are some serious inconsistencies in the court&#8217;s ruling.
