I totally missed <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001339.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001339.shtml', 'this brilliant post from Nathan Newman']);" >this brilliant post from Nathan Newman</a>, written about three weeks ago. He discusses allegations of liberal censorship of conservative speech on College Campuses and takes a surprisingly refreshing new take on the topic:


>   But I don&#8217;t even want to talk about respective media or academic conflict, where, frankly, I think rightwingers and liberals whine too much about bias&#8230; 
>   
>   
>     But let&#8217;s talk about where economic conservatives have almost monopoly control and exercise fascist-like control on a daily basis&#8211; namely the workplace.

>   
>     Too strong a word? Tens of thousands of workers are fired EVERY YEAR for exercising free speech, namely advocating forming a union at work. That suppression of free speech is chronic in workplaces everywhere.
