>   &#8220;PolyFuel, for instance, a spinoff of SRI International, is working on fuel cells for portable devices. The cells essentially break down methanol molecules into protons, electrons and carbon dioxide. While the protons pass through a specialized membrane, the electrons can&#8217;t and get shuffled into a wire powering a cell phone or laptop. The byproducts from the chemical reaction come together as water molecules.
