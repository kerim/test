Mike at Ishbaddidle has a <a href="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/04/04.33.41/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/04/04.33.41/', '10-point plan']);" >10-point plan</a> to take back the country. I especially like point #4 &#8220;Get Beyond Red and Blue&#8221; which I will copy here, since it jibes with some points in my recent &#8220;<a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/11/06/interests/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/11/06/interests/', 'interests']);" >interests</a>&#8221; post and some of the various maps I&#8217;ve been posting.

> In a marketing class at Harvard Business School (yes I have the same degrees as W), we were discussing the cola wars &#8212; Coke vs. Pepsi. &#8220;Why only Coke and Pepsi?&#8221; demanded our professor. &#8220;Because this is America,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;We live in a two-party system!&#8221; Big laugh line, although I don&#8217;t think the prof appreciated it. But there&#8217;s some truth there. We like things black and white. (In the case of race & ethnicity, we like them black and white quite literally.) There&#8217;s a Manichean[1] worldview, good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, paper vs. plastic, Coke vs. Pepsi, that I think goes quite deeply into our national psyche.

> The oversimplification of &#8220;Red America&#8221; and &#8220;Blue America&#8221; has become a cottage industry for pundits like David Brooks, Wayne&#8217;s Worst Export. If you haven&#8217;t read Thomas Frank&#8217;s article &#8220;Lie Down for America&#8221; in the April 2004 Harper&#8217;s, debunking this myth, then by all means read his book &#8220;What&#8217;s The Matter With Kansas?&#8221; See here for more: <a href="http://www.ljworld.com/section/citynews/story/168410" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ljworld.com/section/citynews/story/168410', 'What&#8217;s the matter with Kansas?']);" >What&#8217;s the matter with Kansas?</a>

> The &#8220;Red and Blue&#8221; America myth isn&#8217;t just about making sure that all Democrats aren&#8217;t parodied as latte-drinking Coastal Elites. It&#8217;s important for us to understand that all Republicans aren&#8217;t trailer-park dwelling Bible-thumpers.

> I&#8217;m serious about this. In conversations, on blogs, etc. I&#8217;ve heard this again and again: &#8220;how can people be so stupid / misguided / misled / selfish / immoral as to vote for George Bush?&#8221; In so many words.
> 
> Well, it ain&#8217;t so.
> 
> First, saying stuff like this confirms the worst stereotypes of Democrats: that we think we&#8217;re smarter than other people, that we&#8217;re out of touch with the great masses, that we condescend. Don&#8217;t let them tag you with that one.
> 
> Secondly, as long as we go down that road, we&#8217;ll never understand \*why\* 51% of the electorate went for Bush. You can talk &#8220;false consciousness&#8221; until you&#8217;re blue (or red) in the face, but it won&#8217;t help you in the next election.
> 
> Thirdly, our strategy has to get more &#8220;Red Staters&#8221; &#8212; and more Republicans on our side. Bush picked off 11% of Democrats; Kerry took 6% of Republicans. (Gore got 8% of the GOP vote in 2000). 5.5% of the electorate thinks the U.S. is going in the wrong direction, but voted for Bush anyway.

> This is the best resource I&#8217;ve seen on a better way to look at the country. They divide the nation up into 10 regions, based on voting habits, that cut \*across\* state boundaries: <a href="http://www.massinc.org/commonwealth/new_map_exclusive/beyond_red_blue.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.massinc.org/commonwealth/new_map_exclusive/beyond_red_blue.html', 'Beyond Red and Blue']);" >Beyond Red and Blue</a>

> Fascinating stuff, and I hope every Democratic strategist reads it.

> One last thing &#8212; remember how our rhetoric plays in the mainstream. Our policies don&#8217;t have to move to the center, but our rhetoric should. Demeaning the president&#8217;s intelligence, or those who vote for him, ain&#8217;t gonna play in Paducah. Neither does running naked in the streets, chanting &#8220;No Blood For Oil!&#8221;, etc. Marching is good for the spirit, it&#8217;s a good show of strength, and it energizes the base &#8212; but let&#8217;s try to be sensible. Because you know that it&#8217;s the one guy who kicks a cop that will get all the news, while 100,000 protestors are ignored in their Free Speech Zone.

> We&#8217;re liberals, we&#8217;re good at tolerance; let&#8217;s show some to the other side as we engage in conversation on their blogs, their porches, over beer. Let&#8217;s listen to what they are saying, and strive for civility. We might not convince anyone to switch, but we&#8217;ll show them that our policies and our beliefs aren&#8217;t based in hate, they&#8217;re based in hope. And we could certainly use more civility all around.
