Mercury is bad for you:

It&#8217;s a known nerve toxin and a cause of birth defects. Minnesota and 40 other states now have to warn anglers and their families against eating too much fish because of mercury concentrated in their fillets. Especially at risk of harm are women of child-bearing age, among whom one in 12 is estimated to have dangerous levels of mercury in her body.

And the Bush administration is removing important Clinton era controls to protect us from Mercury in the environment and in our food.
