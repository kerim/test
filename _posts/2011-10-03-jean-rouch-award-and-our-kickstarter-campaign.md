We have some very exciting announcements to make regarding our documentary film, <a href="http://dontbeatmesir.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dontbeatmesir.com', 'Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir']);" >Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir</a>! But before I get to that, I wanted to thank everyone who contributed to our Summer fundraising campaign. We raised just over $5,000 through the generous donations of over fifty people. Thank you all so much! And thanks to the many other people who helped out in other ways: translating subtitles, organizing fundraising parties, and otherwise helping get the word out about our film.

Thanks to your help we were able to get a beautiful new master tape out for the Busan International Film Festival in Korea, where we are having our &#8220;World Premiere&#8221; next week. For anyone whose seen the film before, the new sound mix and coloring, done by some of the same studios responsible for Hou Hsiao-Hsien&#8217;s films, will knock you out of your seats. It is like looking at an entirely new film.

Unfortunately, even with your generous donations and Shashwati&#8217;s tough barganing skills, we still ended up having to borrow money to pay for this work. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve launched a new <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i', 'Kickstarter Campaign']);" >Kickstarter Campaign</a> to raise an additional $5000 to make ends meet. We&#8217;ve already received $940 in pledges, but because of how Kickstarter works, if we don&#8217;t reach our goal by October 15th, we won&#8217;t get a dime. If you <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i', 'pledge just $15 or $20']);" >pledge just $15 or $20</a> you would be making a huge contribution to the film, and you could <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerim/please-dont-beate-me-sir-documentary-film-set-in-i', 'earn one of our many prizes']);" >earn one of our many prizes</a> at the same time &#8211; including the opportunity to download your own digital copy of the film.

Shashwati and I were very proud to learn that the Society of Visual Anthropology will be awarding us this year&#8217;s <a href="http://societyforvisualanthropology.org/?p=1450" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://societyforvisualanthropology.org/?p=1450', 'Jean Rouch Award for Collaborative Filmmaking']);" >Jean Rouch Award for Collaborative Filmmaking</a> &#8211; the SVA festival&#8217;s highest honor. In making <a href="http://dontbeatmesir.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dontbeatmesir.com', 'Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir!']);" >Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir!</a> the films of <a href="http://www.der.org/jean-rouch/content/index.php?id=about" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.der.org/jean-rouch/content/index.php?id=about', 'Jean Rouch']);" >Jean Rouch</a> were a great source of inspiration for us. In particular, we admired the way Rouch collaborated closely with his subjects, employing a variety of devices which we ended up using in our own film. We can&#8217;t think of an award we&#8217;d be more proud to receive.

#### Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival

We are also very excited to announce that our film was selected to be part of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tieff.sinica.edu.tw/ch/2011/en_films_a1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tieff.sinica.edu.tw/ch/2011/en_films_a1.html', 'Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival']);" >Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival</a> (TIEFF). TIEFF is organized by the Taiwan Association of Visual Ethnography and, under the leadership of esteemed Taiwanese ethnographic filmmaker Hu Tai-Li, has grown to be one of the most important ethnographic film festivals in the world. It is truly an honor to be one of the handful of films selected for this year&#8217;s festival.

These include a poster, access to an online version of the film, the DVD, etc. We have been working hard to make sure that each of these prizes is worthy of your support. We promise to get these to you as soon as they are ready, but we need a little more time. Please be patient.

This new version will include the new sound mix and color correction which were paid for with your generous support.

And let us know if you&#8217;d be interested in a campus visit or online discussion via Skype.
