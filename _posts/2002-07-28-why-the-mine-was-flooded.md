I&#8217;m sure everyone saw the headline about the rescue of the miners, but this was at the bottom of the page:


>   &#8220;"I worked that old mine in the 50&#8217;s," said Joe Jashienski, an 89-year-old retired union organizer who watched the rescue efforts from his house here on Schoolhouse Road. "And I remember the last day when it closed they had us working overtime to mine one last big stretch, digging out an extra-huge hole, a hell of a chamber that I&#8217;ll bet never was put on anyone&#8217;s maps."

>     Mr. Jashienski said this final excavation "left an underground room the size of a ball field" that only old-timers like himself knew was down there.
