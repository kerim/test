Last week Bill Poser of Language Log had <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002286.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002286.html', 'a post']);" >a post</a> about Leo Stoller, a Chicago businessman who claims not only to have copyright over the word &#8220;stealth&#8221; but over all instances of the sequential combination of those letters. For instance, he tried suing a company whose URL is: <a href="http://stealthisemail.com/." onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://stealthisemail.com/.', 'Stealthisemail.com']);" >Stealthisemail.com</a>. Most people would read that as &#8220;steal this email&#8221; as in Abbie Hoffman&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=156858217X%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/156858217X%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=156858217X%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/156858217X%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002', 'Steal This Book']);" >Steal This Book</a>, but Stoller saw the word &#8220;stealth&#8221; buried in there.

But owning a sequence of letters isn&#8217;t the half of it. Major companies often claim ownership of sequences of letters which are *similar* to their own brand name, but which are really <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8B7FIU80.htm?campaign_id=apn_tech_down" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8B7FIU80.htm?campaign_id=apn_tech_down', 'misspellings or common typos']);" >misspellings or common typos</a>.

> An Internet arbitrator has awarded Google Inc. the rights to several Web site addresses that relied on typographical errors to exploit the online search engine&#8217;s popularity so computer viruses and other malicious software could be unleashed on unsuspecting visitors.
> 
> The National Arbitration Forum, a legal alternate to litigating in court, sided with a Google complaint alleging that Sergey Gridasov of St. Petersburg, Russia, had engaged in &#8220;typosquatting&#8221; by operating Web sites named googkle.com, ghoogle.com and gooigle.com.
