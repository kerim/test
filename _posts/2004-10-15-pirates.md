I&#8217;ve recently had some comments posted from a 13 year old in Georgia. I welcome all my younger readers and encourage them to feel free to leave comments! (I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;d always assumed that my readers were slightly older.)

Here is a post suitable for all ages:

> <a href="http://www.piratesandemperors.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.piratesandemperors.com/', 'Pirates and Emporers']);" >Pirates and Emporers</a> is a pitch-perfect send-up of the &#8220;Schoolhouse Rock&#8221; musical civics cartoons of the 1970s &#8212; easily the most-compelling educational materials aired on US TV &#8212; in which the dark history of US international policy (funding terrorists, arming atrocity-mongers) is set to jaunty music and simple animation.
