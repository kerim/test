Over <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/041205C.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/041205C.shtml', 'one million']);" >one million</a> U.S. soldiers have served in the wars following 9/11. In just three and half years that&#8217;s &#8220;one-third the number of troops ever stationed in or around Vietnam during 15 years of that conflict!&#8221;

> More surprising is the number of troops who have gone to war since 9/11, come back home, and then were redeployed to the battle zone. Of all the troops ever sent to Iraq or Afghanistan, one-third have gone more than once, according to the Pentagon. In the regular Army, 63 percent of the soldiers have been to war at least one time, and almost 40 percent of those soldiers have gone back. The highest rate of first-time deployments belongs to the Marine Corps Reserve: Almost 90 percent have fought.
