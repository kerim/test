Last March I wrote about a great Hindi movie, a comedy called <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/03/07/mbbs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/03/07/mbbs/', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.']);" ><em>Munnabhai M.B.B.S.</em></a>, which is something of a remake of Rodney Dangerfield&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090685/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090685/', 'Back to School']);" ><em>Back to School</em></a>.
