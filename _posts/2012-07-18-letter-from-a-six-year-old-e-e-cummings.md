From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings#Poetry" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings#Poetry', 'Wikipedia entry']);" >Wikipedia entry</a> on e.e. cummings:

The seeds of Cummings&#8217; unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

> FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,  
> HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,  
> FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,  
> LOVE, YOU DEAR,  
> ESTLIN.
