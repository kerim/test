I&#8217;ve added a feature to the web page version of the blog whereby you can select to view only items in a particular category. Current categories are: &#8220;Afghanistan,&#8221; &#8220;Globalization,&#8221; &#8220;Human Rights,&#8221; and &#8220;Middle East,&#8221; with everything else marked as the general category &#8220;News.&#8221; But please note that these categories only apply to items posted after May 7th, as I will not have the time to go back and assign categories to older items. There is also a general search feature on the web page which you can use to look up older items, but hopefully the categories will be easier to use. (I didn&#8217;t really do anything, this was simply a new feature added when I upgraded the software that runs the site.)
