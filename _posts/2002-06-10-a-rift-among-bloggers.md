This is a silly article, but it is interesting to note that my blog is a &#8220;war blog&#8221; of sorts, although it doesn&#8217;t seem to be of the kind that the NY Times is referring to&#8230;


>   &#8220;Then came the war bloggers. The war-blogging movement took off after Sept. 11 as people used blogs to vent their anger about the terrorist attacks. Though they are still commonly known as war blogs, these sites now address a wide range of news and political topics, usually from right of center.&#8221;
