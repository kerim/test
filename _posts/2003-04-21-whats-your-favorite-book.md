>   So it&#8217;s no surprise that there&#8217;s also early interest in candidates&#8217; answers to the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s your favorite book?&#8221; This may seem an innocuous query, but it&#8217;s actually one of the more treacherous a candidate can answer. In January, for instance, ABC&#8217;s George Stephanopoulos asked Sen. John Edwards to name his favorite book. Edwards replied that it was I.F. Stone&#8217;s &#8220;The Trial of Socrates.&#8221; On the surface, that seemed to hit just the right note. It&#8217;s plausible that an ex-trial lawyer like Edwards would enjoy a book about the ultimate historical trial, and by choosing that particular title&#8211;a serious inquiry written for a popular audience&#8211;Edwards conveyed a sense of weightiness without appearing snobbish. But the choice also opened him up to criticism. Conservative commentator Bob Novak fumed on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Capital Gang&#8221;: &#8220;That&#8217;s incredible! Did Senator Edwards know that Izzy Stone was a lifelong Soviet apologist? Did he know of evidence that Stone received secret payments from the Kremlin?&#8221; Novak&#8217;s rant illustrated how the slightest stumble on the book question can come back to hurt a candidate.
