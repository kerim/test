>   President Bush greeted the people of Iraq on their TV screens. &#8220;You are a good and gifted people,&#8221; he told them as Arabic script appeared below his face. I don&#8217;t know Arabic, but I&#8217;m sure the translation didn&#8217;t convey what Bush means by &#8220;gifted.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t mean exceptional. He means ethnic.

>     This is the seventh time Bush has used the word &#8220;gifted&#8221; during his presidency. Once he was reading from a script at an arts award ceremony. Two other times, he was referring to black people: Bill Cosby and Martin Luther King Sr . On the other four occasions, he was talking about Iraqis or Palestinians .All Iraqis and Palestinians. What, in Bush&#8217;s eyes, makes Iraqis and Palestinians so gifted? The fact that they can run functioning societies .
