But this is the part that upsets me the most. The only reason that Clinton&#8217;s welfare &#8220;reform&#8221; didn&#8217;t end in disaster was because of the earned income tax credit. Now Bush wants to take a swipe at that:


>   Perhaps most strikingly, the administration is imposing stringent new controls over some of the most popular programs for the poor, to stop what the budget documents call &#8220;erroneous payments.&#8221; Under the plan, families applying for free or reduced-price school lunches would have to submit more paperwork, including welfare records and wage data.

>     The Bush plan also calls for the Internal Revenue Service to begin pre-certifying low-income working families that want to claim the earned income tax credit. The EITC &#8212; which is &#8220;refundable,&#8221; meaning that if the credit is worth more than what a taxpayer owes, the extra is paid to the taxpayer in cash &#8212; is the government&#8217;s main assistance program for low-income working families.
