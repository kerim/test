>     &#8230;&#8221;The death penalty is biased in two ways when it comes to race,&#8221; said Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. &#8220;First, blacks make up 43 percent of death row population, but only 13 percent of the U.S. population generally. Second, and more significantly, the race of the victim determines who lives and who dies. Of those executed since 1976, 81 percent were convicted of killing white victims. 19 percent were convicted of killing minority victims.&#8221;
