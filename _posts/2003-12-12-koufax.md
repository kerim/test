Well, its the closest thing we have right now. I voted for <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_dneiwert_archive.html#106188392687332975" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_dneiwert_archive.html#106188392687332975', 'Rush, Newspeak, and Fascism']);" >Rush, Newspeak, and Fascism</a> by Orcinus (<a href="http://www.cursor.org/stories/fascismintroduction.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cursor.org/stories/fascismintroduction.php', 'reprinted here']);" >reprinted here</a>) in the &#8220;Best Series&#8221; post, and I voted for Body and Soul&#8217;s <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/resistance.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/resistance.html', 'Resistance']);" >Resistance</a> in the &#8220;Best Post&#8221; category. Unfortunately, the blogs that get recommended are mostly political blogs, so my voting for <a href="http://languagehat.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://languagehat.com/', 'Language Hat']);" >Language Hat</a> as the best &#8220;single issue&#8221; blog will probably not do much good. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything for the &#8220;Best New Blog&#8221; category &#8230; (hint, hint).
