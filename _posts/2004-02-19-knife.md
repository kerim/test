I have long argued that China&#8217;s attacks on Taiwanese democracy and independence are not as much about Taiwan as they are about keeping Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, and other regions of China under control. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52717-2004Feb18.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52717-2004Feb18.html', 'This Washington Post article']);" >This Washington Post article</a> shows how tense things have gotten in Hong Kong:

> China&#8217;s central government has issued a string of increasingly blunt reminders that it retains the final say over how Hong Kong is governed, seeking to douse activists&#8217; hopes for rapid accession to full democracy in the former British colony.

> The latest warning came Monday in the form of an interview attributed to a senior Chinese official in which he warned that Beijing would be forced to act if the Legislative Council gained a pro-democracy majority in upcoming elections. Wen Wei Po, a newspaper that relays official Chinese views in Hong Kong, said the unnamed official declined to specify whether that meant dissolving the 60-member legislature, leaving the possibility open and reinforcing the gravity of his warning.

But, then again, Bush&#8217;s plan to <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003311.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003311.html', 'force quick elections in Iraq']);" >force quick elections in Iraq</a> shows he never cared about Democracy in the first place. If it wasn&#8217;t about democracy, and it wasn&#8217;t about WMDs, what was it about? Not oil? Couldn&#8217;t be&#8230;
