Bruno Dumont&#8217;s <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120448" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120448', 'La Vie de J&#233;sus']);" ><i>La Vie de J&#233;sus</i></a> is nearly as good as his second film L&#8217;Humanite. He is an amazing director with an acute understanding of the &#8220;psychology of looking&#8221; the camera goes where the human eye would naturally look &#8211; even if that means the crotch. But although there are some shots that might offend, it is mostly a beautiful and distant portrait of dissolate youth in the North of France. He treats his characters humanly and without condencation, while he tries to understand the source of racism and sexual violence. If you can, see it on a big screen!
