They say that on the internet nobody knows your naked, but one can feel quite naked after living one&#8217;s life online for some time. Unless you use a pseudonym, you eventually leave a trail of grumpy comments left on various blogs in the wee hours of the night. Fortunately, these comments are generally not consolidated into one searchable index the way a blog is. So I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m doing this, but I decided to start collecting my comments on other blogs in such an index. I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/comments" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/comments', 'del.icio.us tag for comments']);" >del.icio.us tag for comments</a> I leave on other blogs. It even has <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/kerim/comments" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/rss/kerim/comments', 'its own RSS feed']);" >its own RSS feed</a>. Maybe I&#8217;ll eventually integrate it into the web site, but my sidebar is already overcrowded. So far, I&#8217;ve just been rounding up comments I&#8217;ve left on other blogs (nearly 20 on <a href="http://languagehat.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://languagehat.com/', 'Language Hat']);" >Language Hat</a> alone!), but as I move forward I will bookmark any comments I leave on other blogs. Hopefully this will force me to be more judicious in my commenting! The one big advantage of doing this is that I can go back later and see if anyone responded to my comments. It should also help me track down interesting posts that I might not otherwise have bookmarked.

UPDATE: Nor does it appear that I am the first person to do this. <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/comments" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/tag/comments', 'See URLs tagged with &#8220;comments&#8221; from all del.icio.us users']);" >See URLs tagged with &#8220;comments&#8221; from all del.icio.us users</a>.
