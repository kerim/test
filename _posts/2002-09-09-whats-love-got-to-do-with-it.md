When I first saw this article on &#8220;couple busters&#8221; in Japan, I dismissed it as the latest piece of Japanese-exoticism. (It seems that there is a story every day about some bizarre behavior of the Japanese&#8230;) However, last night I saw the 1939 hollywood movie <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0031647" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://us.imdb.com/Title?0031647', 'Midnight']);" >Midnight</a>, in which Claudette Colbert performs exactly the same service! It happens to be a wonderful mad-cap romantic comedy that really deserves to be listed as one of the best of its genre, so I thought this article in the Washington post would be a nice way to post something about the movie!

A husband who wants to dump his wife will hire a couple-busters firm to engineer an "accidental" meeting between his wife and a good-looking, attentive man who is secretly an agent. Soon, the wife is in an affair with him, and willingly grants her husband a divorce. The agent then fades away, his cell phone turned off, the address he gave her vacant, his workplace number a fake.&#8221;
