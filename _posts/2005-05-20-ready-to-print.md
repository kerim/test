I was going to write another post about what is happening over on *Savage Minds* but I&#8217;m thrilled to pieces with Lorenz&#8217;s review, so I&#8217;ll just <a href="http://www.antropologi.info/anthropology/index.php?id=428d17d20718c" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.antropologi.info/anthropology/index.php?id=428d17d20718c', 'quote him']);" >quote him</a>:

> The anthropology group blog <a href="http://savageminds.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/', 'Savage Minds']);" >Savage Minds</a> is only five days old, but there are already lots of blog entries and even more comments &#8211; or you should rather call the entries for articles: they are well written, detailed &#8211; &#8220;ready to print&#8221;. It looks like as if Savage Minds is on its way to be the most important anthropology site on the net.

Wax&#8217;s reflections <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/19/nothing-is-just/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/19/nothing-is-just/', 'Nothing Is Just']);" >Nothing Is Just</a> after an anthropology lecture he held. He discusses one of the most central issues in anthropology: &#8220;Nothing is Just. Filmmaking isnt just making movies. Marriage isnt just a marker of committment. Family isnt just the people you are related to. Giving gifts isnt just a form of exchange.&#8221;

Thanks. I just hope we can keep it up!<!-- technorati tags start -->
