In <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000353.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000353.html', 'my post on Kerry']);" >my post on Kerry</a>, I mentioned that I felt Edwards had the kind of leadership qualities I thought Kerry was lacking. Here is what William Saletan has to say about the &#8220;most audacious speech of the 2004 presidential season&#8221; (the most audacious speech of the 2003 season <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000279.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000279.html', 'was delivered by Howard Dean']);" >was delivered by Howard Dean</a>):

It may be too crazy to pull off, but it&#8217;s easily the most interesting thing anybody in this race has said so far.

That&#8217;s exactly what the Democrats need to be doing!

But I don&#8217;t like his stance on the death penalty (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/top/news/washington/campaign2004/candidates/johnedwards/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/top/news/washington/campaign2004/candidates/johnedwards/', 'he&#8217;s for it']);" >he&#8217;s for it</a>), and I don&#8217;t like the fact that (like Kerry) he voted to give Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. He is certainly more charismatic than Kerry, but if Bush&#8217;s crew can make a dumb rich frat boy seem likable to a large portion of the voting population, I imagine that Kerry&#8217;s crew can somehow do the same. (See this Saletan article on how Kerry&#8217;s stump speeches <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2094501/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2094501/', 'are being delivered by Ted Kennedy']);" >are being delivered by Ted Kennedy</a>.)

I haven&#8217;t seen any response to this article, but it is certainly troubling for any left-leaning Edwards supporters.
