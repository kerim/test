Hundreds of workers are unable to leave an oil terminal in southern Nigeria which has been occupied by 150 women protestors since Monday.

The terminal&#8217;s operations have been severely disrupted and workers are unable to leave because boat jetties and helicopter landing pads have been occupied, according to the Chevron oil company which runs the terminal.
