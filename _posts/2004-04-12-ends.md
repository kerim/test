I have always felt that one of the strongest arguments for pacifism is that, while the end of &#8220;peace&#8221; is used to justify most modern wars, history has shown us that the end result of war is usually more war. I believe that war should be thought of not simply as a &#8220;means&#8221; to an end, but as complex institution in its own right. Like other complex institutions, such as democracy, both war and peace take practice. If a society spends all its time practicing war, war is what society becomes good at.
