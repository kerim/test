Tom Tommorow had this blog, but I have to wonder if Brezezinki isn&#8217;t trying to simply look like he had more control of events then he really did. I always supected him of being a Kissinger wannabe &#8230;


>   &#8220;Donald Rumsfeld is testifying before the House Armed Services Committee as I write this. I just saw him note that, due to the Soviet Union&#8217;s nuclear weapons, the US was "unable to respond " when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

>     Well, as readers with marginally functioning memories will recall, former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski acknowledged in a 1998 interview (which was widely circulated online last year) that the U.S. deliberately provoked a Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, in hopes of giving them their own Vietnam.

>     Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn&#8217;t believe them. However, there was a basis of truth. You don&#8217;t regret anything today?

>     B: Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.&#8221;
