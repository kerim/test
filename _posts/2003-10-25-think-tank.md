I&#8217;m all for grass-roots politics, but there is no denying <a href="http://www.mediatransparency.org/movement_goes.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mediatransparency.org/movement_goes.htm', 'the tremendous influence that conservative think-tanks have had on the contemporary political climate']);" >the tremendous influence that conservative think-tanks have had on the contemporary political climate</a>. Both domestic and foreign policy have been hijacked by right-wing ideologues with well-financed institutional backing.

It would be nice if the best ideas would rise to the top without such &#8220;wholesaling,&#8221; but that just doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. I hope this new think-tank is able to make a difference.
