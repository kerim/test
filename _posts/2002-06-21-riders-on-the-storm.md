The Drummer from the Doors on why he won&#8217;t sell out.  



>   &#8220;Dread ripples through me as I listen to a phone message from our manager saying that we (The Doors) have another offer of huge amounts of money if we would just allow one of our songs to be used as the background for a commercial. They don&#8217;t give up! I guess it&#8217;s hard to imagine that everybody doesn&#8217;t have a price. Maybe &#8217;cause, as the cement heads try to pave the entire world, they&#8217;re paving their inner world as well. No imagination left upstairs.&#8221;
