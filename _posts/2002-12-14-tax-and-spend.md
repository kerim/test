>   &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m deeply concerned about the words expressed by Senator Lott at Strom Thurmond&#8217;s birthday party. But I&#8217;m even more concerned about the words he used to EXPLAIN them. He said he wasn&#8217;t praising Senator Thurmond&#8217;s past racial stance, but he liked his commitment to a "strong defense" and his "fiscal conservatism."

>     Before the Civil War the Democratic slave masters used to have anti-black conventions where they called us "out-our-names." But after the Civil War, when they had lost power and were trying to get it back, they knew they had to change their language. So instead of holding anti-black conventions, the same former Democratic slave masters had anti-taxpayer conventions &#8211; since they were being taxed to pay for the new freedmen&#8217;s education, health care, and housing. They were known as fiscal conservatives, and they called the Radical Republicans of that day &#8211; who were supporting such programs &#8211; "tax and spend liberals." That&#8217;s the origin of the phrase!&#8221;
