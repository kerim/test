Bush found a reason to block a bill that would have sent money for election reform and the SEC.


>   &#8220;Mr. Bush said, "A lot of that money has nothing to do with national emergency, and I&#8217;ll give you one example: a new facility for storing the government&#8217;s collection of bugs and worms."<br /> <br /> Lawmakers also had included in the bill such items as $400 million for election reform and replacing punch-card voting machines, $9.3 million to beef up the Securities and Exchange Commission, $50 million for fighting forest fires, and $108.2 million for the Army Corps of Engineers.&#8221;
