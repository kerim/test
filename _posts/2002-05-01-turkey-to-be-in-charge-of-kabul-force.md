In a victory for the United States, Turkey agreed today to assume command of the international security force in Kabul, the Afghan capital, sometime this summer&#8230;. Along with the American promise of financial assistance, a Western diplomat said Turkey had insisted that the security forces continue to patrol only Kabul and the surrounding area. Some Afghan leaders have called for a larger force to cover the rest of the country, but the United States has resisted those calls and Turkey said the risks of getting dragged into an internal conflict were too great.
