Here is what he says:

>     But if it&#8217;s true, then surely stabilizing Afghanistan is at least as important? In fact, given the large amount of known al-Qaeda activity in Afghanistan and the continuing Taliban presence there, you could make a pretty good argument that keeping a lid on Afghanistan is more important than Iraq.

Wolfowitz told a House subcommittee in March that Iraq could generate $50 billion to $100 billion of oil revenue over the next two to three years. &#8220;We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon,&#8221; Mr. Wolfowitz said at the time.
