That&#8217;s when war starts. 

As I understand it, Bush is to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/842500.asp?0cv=CA01" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/842500.asp?0cv=CA01', 'give a speech']);" >give a speech</a> tonight at 8:00 in which he will deliver a 48 hour <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/middle_east/2857789.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/middle_east/2857789.stm', 'ultimatum']);" >ultimatum</a> to Saddam Hussein. Since it is rather unlikely that Hussein will comply to the demand that he resign and leave the country, war will start 8:00 Wednesday.

I wish there was something we could do in the next 24 hours to stop Bush. Give him a 24 ultimatum to declare peace &#8230;
