I was going to write a post about how Bush&#8217;s supreme court choices were all about boosting the power of the executive branch, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have to, since Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007316.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007316.php', 'already did']);" >already did</a>. Except I disagree with his conclusion:

> Bush&#8217;s main interest isn&#8217;t with conservative hot buttons like abortion or the &#8220;constitution in exile,&#8221; it&#8217;s with consolidation of his own power.

I don&#8217;t think it is just about personal power. I think it is about subverting democracy. It is much easier to push through a conservative agenda by putting one person in charge who has the power to push it through than it is to win over all of congress. In fact, &#8220;true&#8221; conservatives know that they are a minority and always will be. Controlling the executive branch is the only way they can ultimately prevail. This is *so* about the conservative agenda. Maybe not now, but in the future&#8230;
