I find it difficult to write about New Orleans. I&#8217;ve only visited the city twice, but really loved it. I especially loved the wonderful hospitality I received there. When I was there 12 years ago my friend (who I hope is OK!) told me about the potential for such a disaster. In 2002 I watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/science/delta.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/now/science/delta.html', 'this episode of NOW with Bill Moyers']);" >this episode of NOW with Bill Moyers</a> which stated that &#8220;the risk that a massive hurricane could drown New Orleans gets worse every single year.&#8221; If you do a google search you can find many <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282151.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/1282151.html', 'similar']);" >similar</a><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/o/nov04/nov04c.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/o/nov04/nov04c.html', 'reports']);" >reports</a>.

One thing reported on NOW, which hasn&#8217;t received much attention, was the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_neworleans.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_neworleans.html', 'damage done to the wetlands']);" >damage done to the wetlands</a>, which provide an essential defense barrier:

> New Orleans has always had a huge natural shield that helps protect it from storms: there are miles and miles of wetlands, between the city and the Gulf of Mexico. When a hurricane blows over them, it loses some of its power. But as we reported a couple of weeks ago, this shield is breaking apart.
> 
> And here&#8217;s the irony: the wetlands are disappearing because of the levees. The very levees that were supposed to protect New Orleans. They stopped the Mississippi River from flooding, but it turns out that they also triggered an environmental chain reaction, which is starving the wetlands to death.
> 
> Scientists say if this shield keeps crumbling over the next few decades, then it won&#8217;t take a giant storm to cause a disaster. A much weaker, more common kind of hurricane could devastate New Orleans. 

(I also suggest reading <a href="http://dollarsandsense.org/0705nesiah.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dollarsandsense.org/0705nesiah.html', 'this Dollars and Sense article']);" >this <em>Dollars and Sense</em> article</a> which discusses how shrimp farming has eaten away &#8220;more than half of the world’s mangroves&#8221; &#8211; which provide an essential defense barrier against storms and tsunamis.)

I hate to sound partisan amid such circumstances &#8211; it is very hard to say whether things would be any different in New Orleans right now if it weren&#8217;t for the War on Terror™ &#8211; still, as <a href="http://www.schneier.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.schneier.com/', 'Bruce Schneier']);" >Bruce Schneier</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0387026207%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0387026207%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0387026207%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0387026207%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002', 'argues']);" >argues</a>, money spent fighting the war on terror would be much better spent building up America&#8217;s first responders, but that is just the opposite of how money has been spent.

> homeland security now consists almost entirely of protection against terrorist acts. How else to explain why the Federal Emergency Management Agency will no longer be responsible for disaster preparedness? Given our country&#8217;s long record of natural disasters, how much sense does this make?

It also doesn&#8217;t help that 4,793 members of the Louisiana Army Reserve and Army National Guard <a href="http://bobgeiger.blogspot.com/2005/08/and-how-many-mississippi-reserves-and.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bobgeiger.blogspot.com/2005/08/and-how-many-mississippi-reserves-and.html', 'are in Iraq']);" >are in Iraq</a> right now.

> The poorest 20% (you can argue with the number &#8212; 10%? 18%? no one knows) of the city was left behind to drown. This was the plan. Forget the sanctimonious bullshit about the bullheaded people who wouldn&#8217;t leave. The evacuation plan was strictly laissez-faire. It depended on privately owned vehicles, and on having ready cash to fund an evacuation. The planners knew full well that the poor, who in new orleans are overwhelmingly black, wouldn&#8217;t be able to get out. The resources &#8212; meaning, the political will &#8212; weren&#8217;t there to get them out.
