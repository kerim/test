In the above map, the size of each country represents its linguistic diversity, as recorded in <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ethnologue.com/', 'Ethnologue']);" >Ethnologue</a>. It is taken from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/19/science/19lang.html?ex=1279425600&#038;en=892f555cb0f28dfe&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/19/science/19lang.html?ex=1279425600&en=892f555cb0f28dfe&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss', 'this NY Times article']);" >this <em>NY Times</em> article</a> about Ethnologue.

I first learned of <a href="http://www.sil.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sil.org/', 'SIL']);" >SIL</a> when I was looking online to enroll in the Summer Linguistics Institute (SLI) run by the Linguistic Society of America. I nearly enrolled in the wrong one &#8211; until I noticed that much of the summer would be spent reading the bible. I finally figured out which was the correct program, and it wasn&#8217;t till I went to Taiwan that I met anyone who worked for SIL. There I was truly impressed by excellent scholarly work on Taiwanese Aborigine languages done by at least one SIL worker, who has since become a friend.

The article mentions the controversy over whether SIL missionaries are good or bad for local cutlure. In Taiwan, missionaries aren&#8217;t much of a threat to Aborigine culture these days &#8211; most of them are *already* Christian. And some churches have done a tremendous amount to promote indigenous cultural rights.

On the other hand, this article:

Hart, Laurie Kain. 1973. &#8220;Story of the Wycliffe Translators: Pacifying the Last Frontiers.&#8221; *NACLA&#8217;s Latin America & Empire Report* VII (10).

paints a troubling picture of the role played by SIL in Latin American in the 50s and 60s. It accuses SIL of working as the foot-soldiers of US oil corporations, and various military governments. But then again anthropologists don&#8217;t have a particularly <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/19/anthropologists-as-counter-insurgents/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/19/anthropologists-as-counter-insurgents/', 'glorious history']);" >glorious history</a> either&#8230;
