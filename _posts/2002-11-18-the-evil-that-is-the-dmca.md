>   &#8220;Much has been written about what&#8217;s wrong with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). After all, it&#8217;s been used to jail programmers, threaten professors, and censor publications, and because of it, foreign scientists have avoided traveling to the U.S. and prominent researchers have withheld their work.
