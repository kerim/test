I&#8217;ve added my signature.

In a separate letter to the *Times*, Judith Butler <a href="http://www.humanities.uci.edu/remembering_jd/butler_judith.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.humanities.uci.edu/remembering_jd/butler_judith.htm', 'writes']);" >writes</a>:

It is worth noting that the same thing could have been said about the obituary the *Times* printed for Edward Said, which was equally offensive and ignorant.

Amardeep Singh has <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/10/judith-butlers-obituary-of-derrida.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/10/judith-butlers-obituary-of-derrida.html', 'excerpts']);" >excerpts</a> from Judith Butler&#8217;s obituary of Derrida.

My last post on Derrida is <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/10/10/iterability/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/10/10/iterability/', 'here']);" >here</a>.

UPDATE: The *NY Times* seems to be trying to make up for things with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/14/opinion/14taylor.html?oref=login&#38;pagewanted=print&#38;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/14/opinion/14taylor.html?oref=login&pagewanted=print&position=', 'this Op-Ed piece']);" >this Op-Ed piece</a>. It is marginally better, even if it still worries excessively about &#8220;<a href="http://www.briansiano.com/The%20Great%20Political%20Correctness%20Panic.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.briansiano.com/The%20Great%20Political%20Correctness%20Panic.htm', 'political correctness']);" >political correctness</a>.&#8221;

UPDATE: It is worth noting that, in stark contrast to the *Times*, *Le Monde* had a 10 page section devoted to Derrida the day after he died. Ah, those French <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001482.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001482.html', 'Theory Checkers']);" >Theory Checkers</a> at work again!
