The big question now is &#8220;Who will Kerry pick?&#8221; John Miller in the National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller200402120825.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller200402120825.asp', 'goes through a list of the choices']);" >goes through a list of the choices</a> and picks &#8230; Gephardt.

> The ultimate safe pick. The St. Louis congressman has been vetted enough times to guarantee that there are no surprises lurking in his closet. Although he may be seen as a Democratic dinosaur, he&#8217;s experienced and gaffe-proof. He would put Missouri in play and might help out in other union-heavy Midwestern states (though his poor performance in the Iowa caucuses may suggest otherwise). A Kerry-Gephardt ticket would mollify the party&#8217;s protectionist wing, which is skeptical of Kerry&#8217;s vote for NAFTA a decade ago. Gephardt&#8217;s modest upbringing also makes him one of several contenders who would nicely balance Kerry&#8217;s privileged background. His recent endorsement of Kerry is another plus.

Miller says we won&#8217;t know till the summer, but it is worth taking a look at the list of prospective VPs. I don&#8217;t know much about most of the people on the list, so I&#8217;m not going to venture a guess, but I think that picking a woman or a hispanic would be a good move for Kerry. Not to get the vote from these groups, as Miller seems to think would be the only motivation for such a choice, but to clearly differentiate his ticket from that of Bush. Even if Bush drops Dick for Rudy, as <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003399.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003399.html', 'some have suggested']);" >some have suggested</a>, running a woman or a minority candidate against these white patriarchs would clearly differentiate Kerry without having to play up the &#8220;culture war&#8221; Bush wants to trap him in. But I think an openly gay or lesbian VP is very unlikely. <a href="http://ellen.warnerbros.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ellen.warnerbros.com/', 'Ellen for VP']);" >Ellen for VP</a> anyone? I know she could beet Cheney in a debate!

UPDATE: How about the *other* <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/opinion/03GIL.html?ex=1393650000&#38;en=2667b709bb523c93&#38;ei=5007&#38;partner=USERLAND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/opinion/03GIL.html?ex=1393650000&en=2667b709bb523c93&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND', 'Clinton']);" >Clinton</a>?

UPDATE: Even more far-fetched, <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2096568/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2096568/', 'McCain']);" >McCain</a> for VP?
