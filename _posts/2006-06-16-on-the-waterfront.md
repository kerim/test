That organized crime controls New York and New Jersey&#8217;s waterfront is not news. Elia Kazan&#8217;s classic 1954 film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/', 'On the Waterfront']);" >On the Waterfront</a> (filmed around Hoboken, where I grew up) depicts the (true) story of one man who took on the mob, but as William Finnegan&#8217;s excellent *New Yorker* story &#8220;Watching the Waterfront&#8221; (print only) shows, little has changed since then. Finnegan&#8217;s story focuses on the new attention being paid to organized crime&#8217;s grip on New York Harbor in light of recent security concerns. Of course, the fact that the longshoreman&#8217;s union is one of the strongest unions in the country might be motivating the department of Homeland Security (which has been involved in <a href="http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27c/055.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27c/055.html', 'union busting']);" >union busting</a> since its creation), so I am somewhat dubious of their sudden interest in securing US ports. Still, Finnegan&#8217;s story is well written and full of details that feel as if they were taken from an episode of *The Sopranos*.

For instance, this scene where he goes into a Brooklyn deli with J. Kevin McGowan, the assistant police chief of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor:

> McGowan, who is red-faced and white-haired, was wearing a sharp gray suit that day. We went to lunch at an Italian deli near his office, on the Brooklyn waterfront. He said, &#8220;This is a Gambino place, so we should maybe get our food to go. The former owner, we got him on conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He&#8217;s doing twenty.&#8221; As we approached the deli, an extremely large man in a brown velour tracksuit came out and passed us without looking our way. &#8220;That&#8217;s the new owner,&#8221; McGowan said. Inside, McGowan told the counterman, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing the chicken parm.&#8221; The counterman asked me, &#8220;What did he say? Did he say he was retiring?&#8221; McGowan patiently repeated his order, and the counterman said to me, &#8220;He thinks he&#8217;s saving the world.&#8221; Nobody smiled. 

The legacy of Kazan&#8217;s film is so strong that a major police operation was code-named &#8220;Operation Brando&#8221;! Later, visiting one of the dockyards, Finnegan meets Tom Hanley, a crane operator and union leader who McGowan says &#8220;Must be one of the good guys.&#8221; McGowan grew up in Hoboken back before it was gentrified, when it was more like &#8220;On the Waterfront.&#8221; In fact, Hanley *was in the movie*!

> As a kid, Hanley had a role in &#8220;On the Waterfront.&#8221; He played Tommy, the boy who looks after Terry Malloy&#8217;s beloved pigeons in their rooftop coop in Hoboken, and then, devastated by the news that Malloy has begun coÃ¶perating with a crime commission, kills the birds.
> 
> &#8220;They were building pigeon coops on the roof of my tenement, so the movie company hired me, kind of like you hire a kid to watch your car when you&#8217;re in Harlem. I guess they thought I was going to burn the coops down or something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anyway, I was feeding the pigeons, and I got sent to the Actors Studio, on West Fifty-seventh Street, where Ella Kazan and Budd Schulberg were doing auditions.&#8221; Kazan was the film&#8217;s director, and Schulberg was the screenwriter. &#8220;They deliberately enraged me,&#8221; Hanley said. &#8220;They said, &#8216;We heard your father was a squealer.&#8217; So I went nuts, started throwing chairs at them, and that&#8217;s what they wanted, because there&#8217;s that scene where I throw a pigeon at Brando. At the time, I didn&#8217;t really know who Brando was. But the girls in my neighborhood knew who he was.&#8221;
> 
> The movie company offered Hanley two hundred and fifty dollars a week. &#8220;That was like half a million dollars to us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My mom and I were starving. We were eight months behind on our rent, which was fourteen dollars a month. It lasted only two weeks, but still.&#8221; The work itself was easy. &#8220;Ella Kazan walked me through it. He just kept saying, &#8216;You can do it.&#8217; I&#8217;d never had attention like that before.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;I was on TV once after that, on &#8216;The Red Buttons Show,'&#8221; he said. Then, with impeccable timing, he added, &#8220;I pursued my acting career on the waterfront, where I pretended to be a tough guy.&#8221; 

But the best anecdote in the story goes to another union leader at Hanley&#8217;s dock, Tony Perlstein, &#8220;a longshoreman at Global, who has worked as a labor organizer in other industries, and is a graduate of Brown University&#8221;:

> Perlstein says that he has been threatened, both subtly and otherwise. After one union-local meeting in New Jersey, he was confronted by a group of workers aligned with the Old Guard. &#8220;Hey, Tone, you think we&#8217;re stupid?&#8221; one of them asked. He put a finger in Perlstein&#8217;s face and bellowed, &#8220;I Googled you!&#8221;
