Security Analyst Ian Davis makes some <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,889514,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,889514,00.html', 'very pertinent points']);" >very pertinent points</a> about Powell&#8217;s speech in the Guardian UK. Here is an &#8220;executive summary&#8221;:

  * US intelligence sharing with the UN is not new.


  * The evidence from Powell (when added to the Blix report) makes a strong case for declaring Iraq to be in &#8220;material breach&#8221; of its commitments under resolution 1441.


  * However, most informed analysts believe that Iraq&#8217;s nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capabilities remain underdeveloped, and present a very limited threat beyond the borders of Iraq. 


  * No evidence that Colin Powell has presented today suggests we need to rush headlong into war.
