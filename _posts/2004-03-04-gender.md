> So amidst all the Gay Marriage backing-and-forthing, one thing I haven&#8217;t seen addressed is this: if the Constitution (as amended) will define marriage as &#8220;between a man and a woman,&#8221; then how will we define &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221;?

Born a boy, always a boy. Of course, <a href="http://slate.msn.com//?id=2096495&#38;" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com//?id=2096495&', 'this puts Texas in the curious position of legalizing &#8220;same-sex&#8221; marriage']);" >this puts Texas in the curious position of legalizing &#8220;same-sex&#8221; marriage</a>, according to this article that Ennis sent me, if one partner is, say, a M-to-F TG, and her partner is a born-XX female. In California, however, the TG would be considered a woman &#8212; and therefore unable to marry her partner, unless in San Fransisco. Got that?
