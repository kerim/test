Where were the Hawks when it was their turn to serve?


>   &#8220;Consider Washington&#8217;s two most prominent superhawks: Paul Wolfowitz (Rumsfeld&#8217;s deputy) and his adviser Richard Perle. Who&#8217;s Who in America is curiously vague about their precise whereabouts in the late 1960s, though it is fairly clear where they were not. As the shrewd and sceptical Republican senator Chuck Hagel said last week: &#8220;Maybe Mr Perle would like to be in the first wave of those who go into Baghdad.&#8221;

>     The two Democrat leaders in Congress, Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, served; their Republican counterparts, Trent Lott and Dick Armey, did not. Tom DeLay, the most powerful hawk in the House of Representatives, missed Vietnam too: he was working as a pest exterminator. Reportedly, he once complained that he would have served; but, he said, all the places were taken up by ethnic minorities.

Newt Gingrich, ex-Speaker of the House, went the Cheney route; Kenneth Starr, Clinton&#8217;s legal nemesis, had psoriasis; Jack Kemp, Dole&#8217;s running mate in 1996, was unfit because of a knee injury, though he heroically continued as a National Football League quarterback for another eight years; Pat Buchanan had arthritis in his knees, though he soon became an avid jogger.&#8221;
