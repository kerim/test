In the Simpsons episode about Mojo, the helper monkey, Homer&#8217;s lifestyle slowly ruins the monkey&#8217;s health.

When a colleague asked if I would take over ownership of his 8 month old golden retriever, Juno, I was worried that the same thing would happen to her. While I&#8217;ve always gotten a minimal amount of exercise on a regular basis, I&#8217;m not exactly what you&#8217;d call &#8220;the athletic type,&#8221; and I certainly don&#8217;t have 1/10th the energy of a young golden retriever!

Fortunately, rather than Juno staring at a computer screen blogging all day, it is I who find myself going on morning walks in the mountains behind my house &#8211; something Shashwati points out we didn&#8217;t do once all last year! They say pet owners live longer, healthier lives, and more frequent exercise may be one important reason. (This won&#8217;t help Taiwanese however, as they seem to walk their dogs by driving their scooters!)

In future posts I will write a bit about training Juno, as well as some of the unique challenges to raising a dog in Taiwan.
