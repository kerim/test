Speaking to a friend from Colombia last night, I discovered a new word: *kidnappable*. Actually, the word she told me was in Spanish: *secuestrable*, but doing a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=kidnappable&#038;btnG=Search" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=kidnappable&btnG=Search', 'Google search']);" >Google search</a>, I discover that the word is already being used in English, although it only gets a 175 hits, and only a few of those are in the sense of the word that my friend told me. Most of the occurrences are like this one, from the *National Review*:

> I was told that foreigners in Colombia are eminently *secuestrable*- kidnappable.

This use of the word in Colombia is not surprising, considering the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3916235.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3916235.stm', 'prevalence of kidnappings there']);" >prevalence of kidnappings there</a> &#8211; &#8220;an average of 3,000 people were kidnapped each year between 1996 and 2003.&#8221; Although the number has been <a href="http://www.ejercito.mil.co/english/index.php?idcategoria=73064" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ejercito.mil.co/english/index.php?idcategoria=73064', 'steadily declining']);" >steadily declining</a> since then (if you believe the government statistics).

However, my friend told me that there was a new, more playful use of the term, which has now come to mean &#8220;cute.&#8221; As in: &#8220;That girl is so cute you could kidnap her!&#8221;

> Que ni√±a tan linda como para secuestrarla.

I was curious if this use of the term had penetrated into English. I found a few examples suggesting that it had, but far from enough to suggest a trend. And there isn&#8217;t any clear link between these uses and the Spanish. For instance, this one is from an <a href="http://forum.anipike.com/archive/index.php/t-3006.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.anipike.com/archive/index.php/t-3006.html', 'Anime discussion board']);" >Anime discussion board</a>:

> I love Kaiba Mokuba. He&#8217;s j/ so cute, how he idolizes Seto and everything. He&#8217;s so kidnappable; someone new&#8217;s always trying to steal him away and brainwash him and stuff. I LOVE kidnappable characters, muah!

And this one is from an <a href="http://stanpham.blogs.com/thats_spiffy/2005/03/fear_and_loathi.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://stanpham.blogs.com/thats_spiffy/2005/03/fear_and_loathi.html', 'Asian American blogger']);" >Asian American blogger</a>:

> Sitting at dinner eating my sixth piece of raw fish, I spied a two year old chinese girl sitting at the next table over. Giant cheeks, pigtails, absolutely kidnappable. She was just sittin there eating a slice of American cheese.

Another blogger, by the name of Bob, <a href="http://myblogispoop.blogspot.com/2004_09_01_myblogispoop_archive.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://myblogispoop.blogspot.com/2004_09_01_myblogispoop_archive.html', 'thinks']);" >thinks</a> Bill Murray is &#8220;kidnappable.&#8221; And in a <a href="http://trials-forum.co.uk/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t32353.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://trials-forum.co.uk/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t32353.html', 'discussion']);" >discussion</a> about the movie *Vanilla Sky*, Alexx says &#8220;that both Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz look well kidnappable.&#8221;

NOTE: I don&#8217;t speak Spanish, so let me know if there are any mistakes!
