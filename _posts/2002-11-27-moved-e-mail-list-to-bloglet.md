I moved everyone on the e-mail subscription list to a new service run by <a href="http://www.bloglet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglet.com', 'bloglet.com']);" >bloglet.com</a>. You should have received a message confirming your subscription. Save that message! If you need to change your subscription in the future I can no longer do it for you, but you will have to log on to Bloglet and modify it yourself. However, if you loose your password, you can request a new one to be mailed to you at any time. The advantage of Bloglet is that you can subscribe to multiple blogs and receive only one message each day no matter how many subscriptions you have! It is also HTML formatted for easier viewing. You may receive mail from the old list for a day or two, but soon all mail will be handled only by Bloglet. Please contact me if you have any questions!
