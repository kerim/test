This guy is a genius. I saw him on a TV show, but the economist truly captures the wonderful &#8220;efficiency&#8221; of his style:

&#8220;Unlike any of the 19 other competitors, whose style rarely deviated from the conventional method of starting at one end and finishing at the other, Mr Kobayashi brought a sense of industrial efficiency to the task. Placing a cup of water on each side, he dunked the bun with his left hand and crammed it in his mouth, while with his right hand he dunked the hot-dog and brought it midway up his chest. Then, with both hands, he broke the hot-dog in half and, with one section in each hand, used the sausage as a plunger to force down the bun as he chewed.&#8221;
