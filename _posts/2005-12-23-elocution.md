With all the talk of call centers in poorer countries, one sometimes forgets that they are a booming business in the rich world. In Eugene, Oregon, <a href="http://www.lanecc.edu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lanecc.edu/', 'Lane Community College']);" >Lane Community College</a> has just reintroduced its eight week certificate program for would-be call center employees. As <a href="http://www.registerguard.com/news/2005/12/22/b1.bz.callcenter.1222.p1.php?section=business" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.registerguard.com/news/2005/12/22/b1.bz.callcenter.1222.p1.php?section=business', 'reported by Sherri Buri McDonald']);" >reported by Sherri Buri McDonald</a> in *The Register Guard*, the flier for the program is entitled &#8220;Your New Career is Calling.&#8221;

The description of the program reminded me of a lady I once knew who had studied at <a href="http://www.emerson.edu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.emerson.edu/', 'Emerson College']);" >Emerson College</a>, perhaps sixty or seventy years ago. She majored in elocution. In McDonald&#8217;s article, Shirl Meads of Lane Community College describes some of the new aspects of the program:

> We added diction and enhanced the speech part of it to make sure people are speaking clearly and are using common language &#8211; not slang or colloquialisms.
