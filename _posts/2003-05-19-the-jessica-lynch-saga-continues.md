It is amazing. I wonder if the military will start hiring Steven Spielberg to direct their battles for them. Seems the US military was using blanks when they &#8220;rescued&#8221; Jessica Lynch. 


>   &#8220;It was like a Hollywood film. They cried &#8216;go, go, go&#8217;, with guns and blanks without bullets, blanks and the sound of explosions. They made a show for the American attack on the hospital &#8212; action movies like Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan.&#8221;
