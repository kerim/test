MoveOn is doing a series of ads, each one by a famous director, for the <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/10weeks/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.moveonpac.org/10weeks/', '10 weeks']);" >10 weeks</a> counting down to the election. The ads are decent and effective, but my favorite is a second series of spots they are doing featuring &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-24-moveon-ads_x.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-24-moveon-ads_x.htm', 'Jimmy the Cab Driver']);" >Jimmy the Cab Driver</a>&#8220;:

> Actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006610/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006610/', 'Donal Logue']);" >Donal Logue</a> reprises a role he has played in MTV promos, as a maniacal New York City hack. Jimmy regales his passengers with his political opinions. In one, he talks about how he doesn&#8217;t earn enough to take much advantage of tax cuts signed into law by Bush. &#8220;But I appreciate the gesture,&#8221; Jimmy says of the cuts.

Make sure to see <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/10weeks/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.moveonpac.org/10weeks/', 'this weeks episode']);" >this weeks episode</a> in which Jimmy explains how Bush was &#8220;using his noodle.&#8221;
