A discussion on an e-mail list made me aware of a new word: &#8220;<a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/skinship.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wordspy.com/words/skinship.asp', 'skinship']);" >skinship</a>.&#8221;

> n. Feelings of relatedness and affection between two people, particularly a mother and a child, caused by hugging, touching, and other forms of physical contact. 

The origin of the word is unclear. Debbie Treijs (in &#8220;Japanese skinship; healthy touching between parent and child,&#8221; *Mothering*, September 1, 1999), claims that it was introduced by the WTO during a meeting in Japan in 1940, but the WTO wasn&#8217;t founded until 1948, so it is unclear what she is referring to. Moreover,

> the earliest Japanese citation in *Nihon Kokugo Daijiten*, a 14-volume dictionary similar in scope to the *OED*, is from 1971.

On the e-mail list one professor stated that his university students use the term in a much more sexual way than the original usage implies, so it is possible that the meaning of the word is changing. If so, then then <a href="http://www.skinshipjournal.com/editormessage.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.skinshipjournal.com/editormessage.html', 'Skinship Journal&#8217;s']);" ><em>Skinship Journal&#8217;s</em></a> sales might pick up.
