It seems that <a href="http://www.bloglet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglet.com', 'Bloglet']);" >Bloglet</a> (the service I&#8217;ve been using to send out the e-mail version of this blog) has simply stopped working. Customer service used to be good about a year ago, but now I never get replies to my queries. I&#8217;ve manually disabled that service and re-activated the Yahoo Groups list. So everyone should be getting their e-mails from there. When I have time I will try to make sure that the two lists are synchronized, as some people&#8217;s e-mail addresses have changed. If you want to adjust the settings yourself, or subscribe, please go <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kerimsweblog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kerimsweblog/', 'here']);" >here</a>. I also need to update the subscription form on the site.
