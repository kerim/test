1,806 people were arrested in New York during the Republican Convention. It is now clear that the police were simply harassing people to limit their freedom of speech. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/nyregion/12video.html?pagewanted=print&#038;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/nyregion/12video.html?pagewanted=print&position=', 'Video tape evidence']);" >Video tape evidence</a> has exonerated over 400 people, often showing evidence in direct contradiction to police lies.

> Of the 1,670 cases that have run their full course, 91 percent ended with the charges dismissed or with a verdict of not guilty after trial.

In one especially disturbing case, the video tape presented by the prosecution was *edited* to cut out those scenes contradicting police testimony. Supposedly it was a &#8220;mistake.&#8221; How *convienent*.
