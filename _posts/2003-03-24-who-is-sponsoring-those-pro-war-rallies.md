>   Clear Channel Worldwide Inc., the nation&#8217;s largest owner of radio stations (over 1200 stations in all 50 states and DC), sponsored the numerous &#8220;patriotic rallies&#8221; which were held in various cities around the country. They organized, advertised, provided speakers and entertainment for them, and even handed out numerous American flags to participants.

>     While Clear Channel promoted these as patriotic rallies, the attendees obviously felt otherwise. In addition to waving their provided flags, they also held signs condemning their fellow Americans &#8211; liberals, Hollywood, the Dixie Chicks. They were not so much patriotic rallies as pro-war rallies, and not so much pro-war rallies as rallies against anyone who opposes the Bush administration&#8217;s policies.
