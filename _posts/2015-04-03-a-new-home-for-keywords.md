I'm sick of Wordpress. For many of the same reasons articluated [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-vs-jekyll-might-want-make-switch/). So I moved my [homepage](http://kerim.oxus.net/) and this site over got GitHub Pages using Jekyll. It turns out it wasn't as easy as it looked. [Here's a list](https://gist.github.com/47ae4e51f5de967a43c5) of all the problems I encountered and how I fixed them. But I'm glad I made the change. I'm planning on slowly migrating most (but not all) of my other sites as well. Since I'm still tweaking a few things, let me know if you see anything strange...
