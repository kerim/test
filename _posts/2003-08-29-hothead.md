A lot of democrats seem quite enamored of General Clark. Personally, I am not so sure. While I&#8217;m no fan of Dean either, I feel even more uncomfortable with a general as president. Maybe because it reminds me of other presidents who bore that title: General Musharraf, General Pinochet, General Idi Amin Dada &#8230; I know that is unfair; Clark is clearly an intelligent man <a href="http://www.draftwesleyclark.com/on_the_issues.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.draftwesleyclark.com/on_the_issues.htm', 'with generally liberal views']);" >with generally liberal views</a>, who supports democracy.

Certainly is enough to make me think twice &#8230;
