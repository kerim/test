Does the war in Iraq help to stimulate the U.S. economy? In <a href="http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1199/article11692.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.citypages.com/databank/24/1199/article11692.asp', 'this City Paper interview']);" >this City Paper interview</a>, Doug Henwood why it doesn&#8217;t.


>   CP: One question I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people pose is why there&#8217;s been so little talk of a &#8220;war dividend&#8221; stimulus to the economy.

>     Henwood: Well, a lot of the money&#8217;s being spent on what they call &#8220;support services.&#8221; In the GDP accounts for the second quarter, for example, the military component was growing at a 45 percent annual rate, and that was the highest since 1951. But it was heavily concentrated in these support services&#8211;carrying troops over, setting up bases. The kinds of contracts that Halliburton is getting. It&#8217;s not like the old days when they were making lots of trucks and uniforms and things like that. The old industrial economy got a lot of stimulus out of war procurement. Now it&#8217;s these services, and high-tech weaponry, which is highly specialized, highly automated, and doesn&#8217;t really generate that much job growth.

>     I was talking to a union organizer a couple of weeks ago who was trying to organize a plant where they make the bulletproof vests. These are really low-wage jobs, just classic garment industry jobs where the workers only make a few bucks an hour. So it&#8217;s not like these people are getting high wages out of war procurement. It&#8217;s basically sweatshop conditions.
