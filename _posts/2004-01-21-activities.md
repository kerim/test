I was shocked that Bush still had the nerve to refer to weapons of mass destruction in his state of the union address last night. Calpundit notes that he did not, and offers <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003092.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003092.html', 'this history of White House phraseology']);" >this history of White House phraseology</a>:

**March 2003**: Weapons of mass destruction.  
**June 2003**: Weapons of mass destruction programs.  
**October 2003**: Weapons of mass destruction-related programs.  
**January 2004**: Weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.
