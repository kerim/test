I just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/business/yourmoney/05tech.html?ex=1252036800&#038;en=8fa50cce785ea6c5&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/05/business/yourmoney/05tech.html?ex=1252036800&en=8fa50cce785ea6c5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland', 'read an article']);" >read an article</a> in the *New York Times*, and two minutes later I was speaking to a friend in Taiwan for â‚¬0.022 a minute! That&#8217;s right, less than the cost of a local call. And, if he had <a href="http://www.skype.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.skype.com/', 'Skype']);" >Skype</a> installed on his computer it would be free! The sound quality was decent, much better than older services &#8211; no delay, no echo, just a little static at times. I imagine the quality is even better for Skype-to-Skype calls since it doesn&#8217;t have to rely on local phone lines, although I don&#8217;t (yet) know anyone who has Skype to try it out with.

Goodbye Ma Bell!

UPDATE: I just found out that, like <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/04/coral-it/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/04/coral-it/', 'Coral']);" >Coral</a>, Skype is based on <a href="http://www.skype.com/skype_p2pexplained.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.skype.com/skype_p2pexplained.html', 'P2P technology']);" >P2P technology</a>.
