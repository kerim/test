If anyone is wondering how effective current official investigations into pre-war intelligence on Iraq will be, the answer can be found in <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/iraq/1448.html.pf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/iraq/1448.html.pf', 'this Mother Jones story']);" >this Mother Jones story</a>. It explores the &#8220;Office of Special Plans&#8221; that was set up within the Pentagon by the White House to &#8220;cull&#8221; intelligence data about Iraq. But, because it is in the Pentagon and not the C.I.A., it isn&#8217;t being investigated at all!

> So far, despite all of the investigations underway, there is little sign that any of them are going to delve into the operations of the Luti-Shulsky Office of Special Plans and its secret intelligence unit. Because it operates in the Pentagon&#8217;s policy shop, it is not officially part of the intelligence community, and so it is seemingly immune to congressional oversight.
