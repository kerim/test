It&#8217;s been so long since my roundup on <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/09/02/ss-deep-dixie/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/09/02/ss-deep-dixie/', 'race, poverty and Katrina']);" >race, poverty and Katrina</a>, that a new post is needed.

**First**, some <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/9-19-05pov.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cbpp.org/9-19-05pov.htm', 'hard numbers on poverty']);" >hard numbers on poverty</a> in New Orleans, how it was the sixth poorest city in the country in 2000, how more than half of the poor households didn&#8217;t have a car or truck, and how African American&#8217;s were disproportionately affected. (Link via <a href="http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/09/a_million_here_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/09/a_million_here_.html', 'Mark Schmitt']);" >Mark Schmitt</a>.)

**Second**, Max has a <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001617.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001617.html', 'brief history of &#8220;welfare reform&#8221;']);" >brief history of &#8220;welfare reform&#8221;</a> and the &#8220;war on poverty.&#8221;

> Now that the poverty rate has been rising since 2000, we get all sorts of rubbish about how the rate isn&#8217;t meaningful any longer &#8230; Welfare reform was always a fraud. The evidence for its claims of success never amounted to much. How could it be otherwise? Work doesn&#8217;t pay a single woman enough to raise children. Never has.

And **third**, <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/091905.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pkarchive.org/column/091905.html', 'Krugman']);" >Krugman</a> (via the <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pkarchive.org/', 'archives']);" >archives</a>), reminds us that race plays an important role in how we think about poverty:

> And who can honestly deny that race is a major reason America treats its poor more harshly than any other advanced country? To put it crudely: a middle-class European, thinking about the poor, says to himself, &#8220;There but for the grace of God go I.&#8221; A middle-class American is all too likely to think, perhaps without admitting it to himself, &#8220;Why should I be taxed to support those people?&#8221;
> 
> Above all, race-based hostility to the idea of helping the poor created an environment in which a political movement hostile to government aid in general could flourish.
