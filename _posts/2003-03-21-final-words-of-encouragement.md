The actual speech is <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/3/20/95334/1309" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/3/20/95334/1309', 'here']);" >here</a>. Although I don&#8217;t agree with the whole &#8220;liberation&#8221; perspective in the speech, it really is eloquent and worth reading. It certainly shows more respect for the Iraqi people than Bush has &#8230;
