I wrote about *Shaolin Soccer* on this site back <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000056.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000056.html', 'in August of 2003']);" >in August of 2003</a>, and I only got to see the film today! All I can say is that it was worth the wait! I laughed so hard, I cried. I&#8217;ve heard that they cut out a lot from the original film, which probably explains why it seemed unusually tightly structured for a Hong Kong film. I&#8217;d like to see the uncut version for myself, but I think they did a pretty good job with any re-editing they might have done. And, much to my relief, they did not dub it! They did digitally replace Chinese signs and writing in certain scenes with English, but they chose to provide quality subtitles rather than overdub. If world politics, or anything else, has you down, then run out and see *Shaolin Soccer*!
