What Powell <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2078437/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2078437/', 'said back in 2001']);" >said back in 2001</a> (remember when deficits were bad and the economy was good &#8230; and Bin Laden had nothing to do with Iraq?):


>   When Powell testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee later that month, he dismissed Bin Laden&#8217;s claims. &#8220;We cannot let Usama bin Laden pretend that he is doing it in the name of helping the Iraqi people or the Palestinian people,&#8221; said Powell. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t care one whit about them. He has never given a dollar toward them. He has never spoken out for them.&#8221;
