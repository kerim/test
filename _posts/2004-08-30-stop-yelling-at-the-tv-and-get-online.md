My article, for *<a href="http://www.aaanet.org/press/an/index.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.aaanet.org/press/an/index.htm', 'Anthropology News']);" >Anthropology News</a>*, &#8220;Stop Yelling at the TV and Get Online!&#8221; has just been published. This is the first of a series of articles I am writing and co-editing about the role that online publishing can play in anthropology. In this first article I give a general introduction to the concept of &#8220;blogging&#8221;:

> Do you gnash your teeth at news stories about African “tribalism,” or how some recently discovered gene “explains” human sexuality? Tired of yelling at the TV set? Newspapers won’t print your letters to the editor?
> 
> Until recently there was little an anthropologist could do to rail against the mainstream media. No longer! Self-publication on the Internet used to only be possible for the technologically savvy, but now a new type of software has revolutionized the web, making updating your own website as easy as sending an email. Unlike a traditional website, which often required learning how to manually encode text in HTML, a “blog” (short for “weblog”) automatically formats and displays each new entry as it is posted, archiving older entries by date and subject matter. 

The folks at AN have given me permission to reprint the full article on my wiki. <a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere', 'You can see it here']);" >You can see it here</a>.

We are still looking for articles for the series. If you are interested in submitting one, read on&#8230;
