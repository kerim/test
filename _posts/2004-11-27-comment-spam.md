One of the annoying things about managing a blog &#8211; the only one actually &#8211; is SPAM. For a long time I was able to block spam with a <a href="http://sm.farook.org/WPBlacklist.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sm.farook.org/WPBlacklist.htm', 'program']);" >program</a> which would filter out certain phrases and URLs, but the spammers finally got too smart for that. The same thing has happened to my e-mail as well, and I find I am suddenly getting more SPAM in my inbox. However, with the blog I have some options not available for e-mail: The most effective has been my new <a href="http://coffelius.arabandalucia.com/index.php?p=9" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://coffelius.arabandalucia.com/index.php?p=9', 'CAPTCHA plugin']);" >CAPTCHA plugin</a> which makes sure that only real humans can post by requiring everyone to type out a piece of code which appears in an image field. This has worked great, although Mike <a href="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/25/23.58.33/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/25/23.58.33/', 'points out']);" >points out</a> that it creates accessibility problems for the visually disabled. I&#8217;m very upset about this, and as soon as something better comes along I will replace it, but for the present it is either use CAPTCHA or disable comments altogether. Unfortunately, this has not completely stopped SPAM&#8230; I still get people doing google searches and adding SPAM comments to older posts manually. Not as much as before, but I&#8217;ve decided to implement a third plugin which will disable comments on all posts <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/Auto%20shutoff%20comments" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.wordpress.org/Auto%20shutoff%20comments', 'older than 21 days']);" >older than 21 days</a>. Since most of my &#8220;authentic&#8221; comments are made immediately after I post something, this should work OK without preventing actual discussion which I love.

A full list of WordPress comment SPAM solutions can be found <a href="http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/spam/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/spam/', 'here']);" >here</a>.

And, via <a href="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/25/23.58.33/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2004/11/25/23.58.33/', 'Mike']);" >Mike</a>, there is a list of MovableType comment SPAM solutions <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000246concerning_spam.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000246concerning_spam.php', 'here']);" >here</a>.

I&#8217;m sure spammers will eventually come up with ingenious ways around these blocking methods. And the SPAM fighters will then come up with new ways of blocking them. I just wish that all this creative energy went into something more useful than selling fake rolex watches.
