This is one of the best articles on blogging I&#8217;ve seen. Mostly because it actually discusses the print equivalent &#8211; the pamphlet!


>   &#8220;Of course, in today&#8217;s media-saturated environment, these latest endeavors can hardly expect to sway opinion the way the pamphlet did in its glory days, the 17th and 18th centuries, when master rhetoricians like Milton, Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift and Thomas Paine regularly swamped the public sphere with two-penny treatises on burning social issues.&#8221;
