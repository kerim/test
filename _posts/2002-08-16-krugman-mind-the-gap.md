>   &#8220;Back when I first got professionally obsessed with Japan&#8217;s problems, around four years ago, I made myself a mental checklist of reasons that Japan&#8217;s decade of stagnation could not happen to the United States. It went like this: 
>   
>   
>     1. The Fed has plenty of room to cut interest rates, which should be enough to deal with any eventuality.
>   
>   
>   
>     2. The U.S. long-term budget position is very strong, so there&#8217;s plenty of room for fiscal stimulus in the unlikely event interest rate cuts aren&#8217;t enough.

>   
>   
>     3. We don&#8217;t have to worry about an Asian-style loss of confidence in our business sector, because we have excellent corporate governance.
>   
>   
>   
>     4. We may have a stock bubble, but we don&#8217;t have a real estate bubble.<br /> <br /> I&#8217;ve now had to strike the first three items off my list, and I&#8217;m getting worried about the fourth.&#8221; </blockquote>
