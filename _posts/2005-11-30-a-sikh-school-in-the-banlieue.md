One consequence of France&#8217;s law against the headscarf has been that Sikh boys cannot attend public school if they wear topknots or turbans. French newspaper *Libération* reported yesterday <a href="http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147', 'that a private school will be set up by 2007 for some of these students']);" >that a private school will be set up by 2007 for some of these students</a>. But AFP reported on the same day that the mayor of the *banlieue* (suburb) concerned <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-26155143@7-54,0.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-26155143@7-54,0.html', 'did not wish to have such a school in his town']);" >did not wish to have such a school in his town</a>.

This is a photo that I took of a Sikh march in Paris in January 2004 protesting the ban:

The commission set up by French president Jacques Chirac to advise on a law regarding the headscarf never included Sikhs in their hearings, as Elaine Sciolino <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/international/europe/12FRAN.html?ex=1389848400&en=6040a2b91dd963f9&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/international/europe/12FRAN.html?ex=1389848400&en=6040a2b91dd963f9&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND', 'reported in the ']);" >reported in the </a>*<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/international/europe/12FRAN.html?ex=1389848400&en=6040a2b91dd963f9&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/international/europe/12FRAN.html?ex=1389848400&en=6040a2b91dd963f9&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND', 'New York Times']);" >New York Times</a>*:

Now it&#8217;s in the government&#8217;s hands.&#8221;

The French parliament went ahead and passed the law without any further hearings. <a href="http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147', 'The report by Marie-Joëlle Gros in ']);" >The report by Marie-Joëlle Gros in </a>*<a href="http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=341147', 'Libération']);" >Libération</a>** *describes the impact on the Sikh community in the the *département* of Seine-Saint-Denis, which neighbors Paris. Four Sikh students were kicked out of school. Three of them failed their school year last year, and are now repeating the year at a Catholic school that has accepted them. The fourth was a vocational student, kicked out this year, and he has gone to work for his father.

The report goes on to say that the Gurudwara Sachkhand Guru teg Bahadur association is setting up a private school, to open in 2007.
