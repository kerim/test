No, you are not lost &#8211; this is *Keywords*, I&#8217;ve just upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/', 'WordPress 1.5']);" >WordPress 1.5</a> and figured it would be easier to adapt an <a href="http://www.alexking.org/software/wordpress/themes/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alexking.org/software/wordpress/themes/blog/', 'existing theme']);" >existing theme</a> rather than convert my heavily modified older theme to work with the new software. Upgrading means I can use a host of new <a href="http://www.wp-plugins.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wp-plugins.net/', 'plugins']);" >plugins</a>, as well as easily switch between themes, so don&#8217;t be surprised if things keep on changing around here for a while! Feedback is always welcome!

UPDATE: Well, everything is up and running, although I still need to add my blogroll, and tweak a few other features and settings, but at least the basics are there. I&#8217;ve installed the <a href="http://www.unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma', 'Spam Karma plugin']);" >Spam Karma plugin</a> so hopefully I can re-enable comments on older posts as well as trackbacks without getting swamped by spammers.
