There was a lot of attention paid to the fact that Republicans in Florida were pushing voters to <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/irony_of_the_da.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/irony_of_the_da.html', 'cast absentee ballots']);" >cast absentee ballots</a>. But it seems that this is a much more widespread phenomenon, and that both parties are urging supporters to lock in their vote in a number of states where it is legal to vote early by absentee ballot. From <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001821.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001821.shtml', 'Nathan Newman']);" >Nathan Newman</a> (emphasis added):

> At least a dozen battleground states allow voters to cast ballots early, including Florida, West Virginia, Nevada, Arizona and Iowa.
> 
> Both liberal and conservative groups are already mobilizing to get those ballots turned in as early as possible as part of their GOTV operations. Estimates are that **up to one third of ballots will already have been cast by November 2**.

The original <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB109280000506594531,00.html?mod=todays%5Ffree%5Ffeature" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB109280000506594531,00.html?mod=todays%5Ffree%5Ffeature', 'Wall Street Journal article']);" ><em>Wall Street Journal</em> article</a> points out that this could create a number of problems, including the potential to pressure people into public voting:

> each step in the process &#8212; an individual voter&#8217;s request for an absentee ballot, the elections official&#8217;s mailing of the ballot and the voter&#8217;s return of that ballot &#8212; becomes a matter of public record. During the early voting period, campaigns can communicate specifically with voters who have received ballots but haven&#8217;t yet voted. &#8220;ACT is going to know exactly what&#8217;s happening&#8221; with its target universe, says Mr. Link, the Iowa director.

While the WSJ focuses on liberal groups such as <a href="http://actforvictory.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://actforvictory.org/', 'ACT']);" >ACT</a>, I think this really is a cause for concern no matter which side you are on. Not to mention the way in which early election results will affect the November vote.
