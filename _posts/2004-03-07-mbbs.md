An M.B.B.S. is the Indian medical degree, the equivalent of the American M.D. However, in the latest Bollywood hit, <a href="http://www.munnabhaimbbs.com/home.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.munnabhaimbbs.com/home.htm', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.']);" >Munnabhai M.B.B.S.</a>, it comes to stand for much more than that. Here is the official synopsis:

> Munnabhai is a happy man. He lives with his gang in the bylanes of a &#8216;dhobi ghat&#8217; in Mumbai; takes pride in being a &#8216;social worker&#8217; (they actually settle &#8216;financial disputes&#8217; through &#8216;dadagiri&#8217; [kidnapping]); and enjoys his booze, babes, brawls followed by a good night&#8217;s sleep. Not much bothers Munna.
> 
> Except his parents&#8217; annual visit from the village. Munna&#8217;s father, Hari Prasad Sharma, an upright, moralistic man believes that his son is actually a doctor running a charity hospital. Every year, when his parents arrive, Munna and his gang bathe, shave, don white coats and stethoscopes and pretend to be diligent doctors.
> 
> This year, however, the clever charade falls apart. Hari Prasad Sharma&#8217;s runs into an old friend, Dr. Asthana, who has a daughter called Suman. The two decide that their children, both doctors, would make a perfect match. Munna tries hard to save the situation, but his father discovers the truth. And all hell breaks loose.
> 
> Hari Prasad Sharma, now broken by the truth, removes his white spotless &#8216;pagadi&#8217; and cries. Munnabhai then takes a decision that would change many lives : he decides to become a doctor.
> 
> Munnabhai MBBS is a hilarious and heart warming story of a local goon&#8217;s journey into the medical world &#8211; a place he neither belongs to nor believes in. It is a classic story of a right man in a wrong place.

The film is reminiscent of Rodney Dangerfield&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090685/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090685/', 'Back to School']);" >Back to School</a>, with Munna&#8217;s gang always ready to help him out of a jam; but is much more fun. In one scene Munna is having trouble seeing an autopsy because there are so many students crowded around. When the professor tells him to &#8220;get your own body&#8221; &#8211; he calls his mates and they promptly deliver &#8211; except the tourist isn&#8217;t quite dead. I haven&#8217;t laughed so hard in a while &#8211; and there are wonderful song and dance scenes. This isn&#8217;t low budget silliness like 80s Hong Kong movies, this is a very polished and sophisticated comedy that is heads and shoulders above the crap coming out of Hollywood this Spring Break. Highly recommended!
