Whether it is <a href="http://blog.shashwati.com/index.php?p=29" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.shashwati.com/index.php?p=29', 'taking pictures']);" >taking pictures</a> in public places, or <a href="http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/001518.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/001518.html', 'using a wireless connection']);" >using a wireless connection</a> outside a library, it seems that the police and even the population at large feel free to just make new laws up as they please. So, while we&#8217;re at it, here are some new laws I will start enforcing today:

  * No playing games on your cell phone in public places.
  * No smoking while walking in front of me on the sidewalk.
  * No standing still in or near public doorways.
  * No Mayonnaise.
  * No watching Fox News.
  * No reality TV.

Those are today&#8217;s laws. I&#8217;ll probably make different ones up tomorrow, so be sure to check back!

UPDATE: Know <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/22/constitutional_right.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/22/constitutional_right.html', 'what your rights are']);" >what your rights are</a>. (And a special hand out for RNC protesters <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/22/constitutional_right.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/22/constitutional_right.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.)
