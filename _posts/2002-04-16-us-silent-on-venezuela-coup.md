A number of papers ran with articles or op-ed pieces about the failure of the US to denounce the coup in Venezuela. Including the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-000027187apr16.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dworld" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-000027187apr16.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dworld', 'LA Times']);" >LA Times</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56302-2002Apr15.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56302-2002Apr15.html', 'the Washington Post']);" >the Washington Post</a>, and Krugman in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/16/opinion/16KRUG.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/16/opinion/16KRUG.html', 'NY Times']);" >NY Times</a>. There is also additional reporting in <a href="http://www.counterpunch.com/wilpert0415.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.counterpunch.com/wilpert0415.html', 'CounterPunch']);" >CounterPunch</a> and a bunch of stuff on <a href="http://www.zmag.org/venezuela_watch.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zmag.org/venezuela_watch.htm', 'Znet']);" >Znet</a>. My brother also sent a letter to the NY Times pointing out what no one else seems to be saying, which is that with a pending Oil Crisis, there is a very real motivation for the US not to speak out against the coup.
