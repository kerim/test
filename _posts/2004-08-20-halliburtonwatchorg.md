> Halliburton announced yesterday that the Army would withhold 15 percent of future payments because of suspicious bills. A few hours later, the Army announced it would not withhold those payments, but would instead give Halliburton more time to explain why it billed taxpayers for work that was apparently never undertaken or completed. The Army&#8217;s decision is the third time it has extended the deadline for Halliburton to justify undocumented expenses, including $1.8 billion of $4.5 billion that Halliburton charged U.S. taxpayers for work in Iraq and Kuwait, which the Defense Contract Audit Agency recently reported the company has yet to substantiate.
