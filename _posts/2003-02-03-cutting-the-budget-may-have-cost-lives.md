>   When an expert NASA panel warned last year that safety troubles loomed for the fleet of shuttles if the agency&#8217;s budget was not increased, NASA removed five of the panel&#8217;s nine members and two of its consultants. Some of them now say the agency was trying to suppress their criticisms.
