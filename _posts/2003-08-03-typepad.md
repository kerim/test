Those of you who used to read my <a href="http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/', 'old blog']);" >old blog</a> have probably noticed that things are a little spiffier since I switched to my <a href="http://test.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/', 'new site']);" >new site</a>. Part of the reason is the wonderful free software I use, <a href="http://movabletype.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://movabletype.org/', ' Movable Type']);" > Movable Type</a>. But for those of you who want your own blog without having to go through the trouble of <a href="http://000domains.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://000domains.com/', 'registering a domain']);" >registering a domain</a>, finding a <a href="http://www.hostmatters.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hostmatters.com/', 'web host']);" >web host</a>, and installing your own software to run the whole thing &#8230; there is good news! The makers of Movable Type have launched a new web service where anyone can sign up and get their own blog. It is called <a href="http://www.typepad.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.typepad.com/', 'TypePad.com']);" >TypePad.com</a>.

There are three levels of service, but even the most basic one comes with most of what you&#8217;d want for **less than $5 a month**.

Why am I posting what is basically an advertisement? Mostly because I think everyone should have <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000017.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000017.html', 'their own blog']);" >their own blog</a>. But also because so many people use poorly written software that makes their blogs hard to read. Some don&#8217;t have individual permanent links to each of their entries, some are impossible to comment on, and what&#8217;s worse, many don&#8217;t even have a proper <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1268" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1268', 'RSS feed']);" >RSS feed</a>!

But now you can see the difference. Take a look at <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/', 'Body and Soul&#8217;s new TypePad site']);" >Body and Soul&#8217;s new TypePad site</a>, it is a major improvement over <a href="http://bodyandsoul.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.blogspot.com/', 'her old one']);" >her old one</a>. Like many blogs, the old one was run using <a href="http://new.blogger.com/home.pyra" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://new.blogger.com/home.pyra', 'Blogger']);" >Blogger</a>. Blogger helped start the blogging revolution, but it just hasn&#8217;t kept up with the times &#8230;

The folks at TypePad seem to have done a good job of making it easy to use for the total beginner, as well as packing lots of features in that more advanced users can make use of. If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog and thought of having your own, or you are using some software that never works right &#8211; give TypePad a try!
