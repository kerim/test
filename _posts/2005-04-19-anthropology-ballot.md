> I admit it, I normally throw my AAA ballot in the circular file. But this year I didn&#8217;t, because I knew that there were some important labor related issues at stake. However, as I sat down to vote, I realized just how confusing the wording is for Referendum #2. Although it might seem otherwise, if you wish to support the collective bargaining rights of workers in the United States, you should vote &#8220;no&#8221; on this referendum!
