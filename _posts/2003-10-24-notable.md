Inspired by <a href="http://www.prometheus6.org/archives/002094.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prometheus6.org/archives/002094.html', 'Prometheus6']);" >Prometheus6</a>, I&#8217;ve started a &#8220;best of&#8221; section of my own. These are entries that I&#8217;ve put a little more thought than usual into, or which I&#8217;m proud of for some reason. This way those entries won&#8217;t disappear from the front page of this site simply because they are out of date. I&#8217;ve called it &#8220;Notable Entries&#8221; and it displays the last 10 entries in the &#8220;Notable Category&#8221;. There aren&#8217;t more than 10 listed yet, but when there are you can see them all by <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/cat_notable.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/cat_notable.html', 'clicking on the link in the category section']);" >clicking on the link in the category section</a>.
