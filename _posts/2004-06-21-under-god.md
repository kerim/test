There has been <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/moveabletype/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2&#038;search=under+god" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/moveabletype/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2&search=under+god', 'great discussion']);" >great discussion</a> of the phrase &#8220;under God&#8221; as it is used in the Pledge of Allegiance over at LanguageLog. The long and the short of it is that the phrase, as used by Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address, <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001089.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001089.html', 'from which the words were taken']);" >from which the words were taken</a> when the Pledge was updated, was not used in the same way as it is in the Pledge. <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001090.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001090.html', 'Geoff Nunberg explains']);" >Geoff Nunberg explains</a>:

> In short, the phrase &#8220;under God&#8221; had nothing to do with God&#8217;s temporal sovereignity; it was, rather, a way of acknowledging that the efforts of men are always contingent on His providence. And that is how Lincoln intended it, as meaning something like &#8220;with God&#8217;s help, of course&#8221;:

> &#8230; Lincoln would have had trouble making sense of the use of the words in the Pledge &#8212; to him it would have been an ungrammatical way of saying something like, &#8220;one nation, with God&#8217;s help (of course), indivisible&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;one nation, after God, indivisible&#8230;&#8221; As I said in my earlier post, a strategic misreading of history.
