Philips is getting a lot of attention for having <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0403/04030302philipsfluidlens.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dpreview.com/news/0403/04030302philipsfluidlens.asp', 'invented a new kind of lens']);" >invented a new kind of lens</a> that might be used in cell phones and other small electronics that currently don&#8217;t offer lenses with the ability to focus. This is done by using two liquids that don&#8217;t mix, and applying a small electrical charge to change the shape of the lens. Or, more technically:

> The Philips FluidFocus lens consists of two immiscible (non-mixing) fluids of different refractive index (optical properties), one an electrically conducting aqueous solution and the other an electrically non-conducting oil, contained in a short tube with transparent end caps. &#8230;
> 
> The shape of the lens is adjusted by applying an electric field across the hydrophobic coating&#8230;

But what is really interesting is that the idea, or at least parts of it, is not new. According to my friend, <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/~sanford/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://astro.temple.edu/~sanford/index.html', 'J. Greenberg']);" >J. Greenberg</a>, an expert on older cameras, this is

> an idea from 1859, when Thomas Sutton filled a glass ball with water, mounted it on a piece of metal, and called it the &#8220;Sutton Panoramic Lens&#8221;. Later reinvented by JG Baker in 1942.

For more info, he recommends the book <a href="http://www.addall.com/New/BestSeller.cgi?isbn=0124086403&#38;dispCurr=USD" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.addall.com/New/BestSeller.cgi?isbn=0124086403&dispCurr=USD', 'A History of of the Photographic Lens']);" >A History of of the Photographic Lens</a>, by Rudolf Kingslake.
