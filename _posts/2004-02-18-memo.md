I thought this captured <a href="http://politics.slate.msn.com/id/2095529/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://politics.slate.msn.com/id/2095529/', 'the difference in communication skills']);" >the difference in communication skills</a> that separates Edwards from Kerry:

> Edwards fired off the night&#8217;s best line in response to Kerry&#8217;s tortuous answer to a question about whether he feels &#8220;any degree of responsibility for the war and its costs and casualties&#8221;: &#8220;That&#8217;s the longest answer I ever heard to a yes or no question. The answer to your question is: of course; we all accept responsibility for what we did.&#8221; (The Dean campaign followed up with a press release stating only, &#8220;Memo to John Edwards: You are so right.&#8221;)
