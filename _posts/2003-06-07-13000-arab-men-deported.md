>   Remember the forced Arab male registration program Bush instituted this past year? Where all of the muslim males from several countries had to register with the Government as part of the plan to make us safer? 13,000 of those men who followed the directive, believing they would have a chance to argue to stay here, are being deported. Only a few have been linked to terrorism.
