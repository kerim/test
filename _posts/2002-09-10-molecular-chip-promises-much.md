>   &#8220;Researchers at the Hewlett-Packard research labs have turned to nanotechnology to help create a system that can store at least 10 times as many bits as existing silicon memory. 
>   
>   
>     The team have created a working prototype mini-memory that is barely one micron square. More than 1000 of these prototypes would fit on the tip of a human hair.
