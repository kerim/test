It seems that <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030702/media_itunes_1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/030702/media_itunes_1.html', 'some artists']);" >some artists</a> are boycotting the Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.apple.com/music/store/', 'Music Store']);" >Music Store</a> because they won&#8217;t sell albums unless the artists also agree to let Apple sell the songs individually as well. I can understand this &#8211; as &#8220;artists&#8221; they want to control how people experience their product. But, to be honest, even if I go out and buy a whole CD, the first thing I do is rip it to iTunes where, while I might listen to the album straight through one time, from then on I&#8217;ll listen to each song individually in random mix mode. I guess I missed out on that whole sixties <a href="http://users.pandora.be/mapinguari/apple/Beatles.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://users.pandora.be/mapinguari/apple/Beatles.htm', 'vinyl album fetish']);" >vinyl album fetish</a> thing.

But I have a different problem with the Apple music store policy of selling albums as individual songs. While some albums can be bought for a discount if you buy the entire album &#8211; some albums must be bought song-by-song. This can be quite expensive if the album has lots of songs. While their albums often go for under $10, the individual songs are all 99 cents, and an album with 16 or 20 songs costs a lot without a discount. It reminds me of grocery stores in the poorer neighborhoods of Philadelphia where they would cell individual cigarettes to those too poor to buy a whole pack, or the discount stores in my neighborhood in Queens where they sell items from &#8220;buy one get one free&#8221; packages as individual items.
