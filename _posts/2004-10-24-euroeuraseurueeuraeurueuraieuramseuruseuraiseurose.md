> All official EU texts must be spelt the same way even if it makes no sense in the Baltic languages.
> 
> The biggest headache is for the 3.5 million people of Lithuania, who would normally write euras, eurue, eura, euru, eure, eurai, eurams, eurus, eurais and eurose, depending on the word&#8217;s function in a sentence. The genitive in particular has caused tempers to fray.
> 
> In a letter to the Dutch EU presidency, the Lithuanian government insisted: &#8220;The non-inflective form of the term euro is unacceptable to the Lithuanian language.&#8221;
> 
> The Dutch offered a compromise yesterday that would insist on the &#8220;euro&#8221; spelling for all official EU texts such as the constitution, but let states vary usage in national documents provided the first three letters are &#8220;eur&#8221;. This is not much help to Latvia, where the word begins with &#8220;eir&#8221;.
