The &#8220;<a href="http://www.isbushwired.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.isbushwired.com/', 'is Bush wired']);" >is Bush wired</a>?&#8221; story is getting more and more coverage. <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/08/bulge/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/08/bulge/', 'Salon']);" >Salon</a> has a story today. Much has been made of the fact that the debate rules were intended to prevent any pictures of the candidates from the back; however, nobody has mentioned this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/21/debate.highlights/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/21/debate.highlights/', 'other']);" >other</a> curious rule:

> Other than Secret Service personnel and the president&#8217;s doctor and military aide, each candidate is allowed to have only one pre-designated staff member in the wings or the immediate backstage area.

Now why might Bush need someone in the wings, or &#8220;immediate backstage area&#8221;?

Lets assume that the story is true &#8211; how might it affect tonight&#8217;s debate? Would he risk doing it again? Will people be ready to catch him in the act? Can Bush function without prompting? The story adds a whole new level of excitement to the debate.

UPDATE: Well, Bush didn&#8217;t seem to have a box on his back this time. Maybe it was under his arm? <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001537.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001537.html', 'Mark Liberman']);" >Mark Liberman</a> doesn&#8217;t think that Bush is being prompted &#8211; his wild, almost random, repetitions of stock phrases seems to suggest that he&#8217;s not.
