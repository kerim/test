  <blockquote>
    
      Compared with the pairing of First World employers and Third World workers, the hiring of migrant domestic workers in the global South involves more ambiguity and contestation in the power geometry of employment relationships. The encounter between Taiwanese newly rich employers and Filipina downwardly mobile migrants, in particular, is theoretically interesting in this regard. For example, a Hungarian domestic worker once summed up her Candian employers by saying, &#8220;They think you are as stupid as your English is&#8221;&#8230; By contrast, one college-graduated Filipina domestic worker in this research said of her Taiwanese employers, &#8220;They have more money but I speak better English!&#8221;
