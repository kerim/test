We got a &#8220;free&#8221; Lexmark printer with the purchase of one of our computers. Don&#8217;t ever fall for such a trick. It is like giving crack out for free. The printer is free, but they they screw you with the cost of ink cartridges. Now they&#8217;ve even <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/05/012205" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/05/012205', 'won a court case']);" >won a court case</a> allowing them to prevent third party companies from refilling their ink cartridges. This is really pushing copyright law too far. The more rulings like this come out the more I agree with those who want to eliminate copyright altogether! The only solution is to use some do-it-yourself refill kits, which we&#8217;ve been using successfully. (You can get these at <a href="http://www.carrotink.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.carrotink.com/', 'CarrotInk.com']);" >CarrotInk.com</a> and other such places.)

In related news: Remember when <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/archive/news/1050600992.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.arstechnica.com/archive/news/1050600992.html', 'Madonna attempted to stifle online sharing of her new album by releasing &#8220;decoy&#8221; tracks']);" >Madonna attempted to stifle online sharing of her new album by releasing &#8220;decoy&#8221; tracks</a>? They had a short message from Madonna:

Well, Madonna&#8217;s latest music video seems to be an unlicensed ripoff of another artists work. <a href="http://www.guybourdin.org/hollywood/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guybourdin.org/hollywood/', 'As this site makes very clear']);" >As this site makes very clear</a>. Seems like someone should send a special message to Madonna&#8230;
