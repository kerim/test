When the 9-27 earthquake happened in Taiwan, I remember that it was a lucky thing it happened at night. Most of the schools near the epicenter collapsed &#8211; as did other government built buildings (police stations, etc.). I&#8217;m usually not an advocate for privatization &#8211; but it seems clear that government corruption is to blame.


>   &#8220;As Italian villagers grieved yesterday for the children killed when their school collapsed in an earthquake, anger was rising over why the building folded like a house of cards.&#8221;
