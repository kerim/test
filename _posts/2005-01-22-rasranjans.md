We spent most of our time in <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/12/27/ahmedabad/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/12/27/ahmedabad/', 'Ahmedabad']);" >Ahmedabad</a> in what might be called a &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slum</span> ghetto,&#8221; but everyone always talks about what a wealthy city it is. So, to see the other side of life in Ahmedabad, we visited the famous Rasranjan restaurant.

This popular place serves traditional Indian street foods in a modern, McDonald&#8217;s-like environment.

The food was great &#8211; and it didn&#8217;t make us sick like real street food is likely to do in India &#8211; but there was something a little strange about the place. It wasn&#8217;t the Santa, although he was a little scary if you ask me.

Nor was it the &#8220;American Vegetable Chopsey&#8221; which was quite tasty despite the name.

No, it was the ice cream desert named &#8220;Hitlers Sundae&#8221;!

When Shashwati asked why they called it that the manager responded that it was because &#8220;it is so dark with Chocolate.&#8221; The logic of this is completely beyond me, but there you have it. It reminds me of when I was in Taiwan and <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/11/23/11877" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/1999/11/23/11877', 'some company used a little cartoon Hitler to advertise electric heaters']);" >some company used a little cartoon Hitler to advertise electric heaters</a>. It didn&#8217;t take long, after it was reported in the press, for the German manufacturer to demand that they use a less offensive mascot.
