>   &#8220;There&#8217;s been a very, very big deterioration in security countrywide, especially for aid workers,&#8221; said Rafael Robillard of ACBAR, an umbrella group of 86 aid agencies in Kabul. &#8220;Aid workers are being specifically targeted by people trying to destabilize the government, which is very dependent on aid. We&#8217;re easy targets. It&#8217;s a serious problem.&#8221;
