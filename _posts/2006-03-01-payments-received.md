It seems that one stamp is not enough. It is a little out of focus, but you can see they gave me a second stamp to use to sign all &#8220;Payments Received&#8221; documents. Actually, I don&#8217;t even get to keep this stamp. The ever helpful administrative assistant keeps it and stamps things for me. She just wanted to show it to me, so I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d share it with you as well. My other stamp &#8211; for signing receipt of memos, is to the left for comparison.
