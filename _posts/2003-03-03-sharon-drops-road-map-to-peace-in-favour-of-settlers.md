>     &#8230;&#8221;He is saying there is no road map, no peace process. It&#8217;s a government for the settlers, from the settlers and by the settlers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think Sharon made it clear tonight that he wants the Palestinians to surrender to him. I hope President Bush will see the light.&#8221;
