Juno went into heat last week, and with so many stray dogs around, we thought it best to have her spayed right away. We have a very good vet whose wife is actually a graduate student in our department. You can <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/blog/vetke" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wretch.cc/blog/vetke', 'see their blog here']);" >see their blog here</a>, full of pictures of all the goats and pigs (as well as dogs and cats) who come in to their clinic.

We were worried at first because we were told that Juno would feel better the next day, but she hardly ate anything for three days and seemed to still be feeling unwell two days after the operation. But on Monday morning she jumped up as if nothing had ever been wrong and was hungry, playful, and seemed genuinely happy not to be feeling unwell anymore &#8211; almost dancing.

The stitches and cone come out Friday.
