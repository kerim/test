David Corn makes <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20040315&#38;s=corn" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20040315&s=corn', 'a strong case that Kerry is no &#8220;Bush Lite&#8221;']);" >a strong case that Kerry is no &#8220;Bush Lite&#8221;</a> and has the courage to stand up for issues he believes in. Much of this is covered in my earlier <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000353.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000353.html', 'post on Kerry']);" >post on Kerry</a>, but Corn goes beyond Kerry&#8217;s investigations to look at his legislative record as well.

> After two decades in the Senate, Kerry has a long record that can be picked apart by competitors within his own party as well as in the GOP. &#8230; But there have been times he has shown courage, devotion to justice and commitment to honesty, open government and principle-over-politics. There are few senators of whom that can be said. A full assessment of the man ought to take these portions of his public service into account.
