True story: when I was a kid I once got yelled at by Andy Warhol who thought I was surreptitiously taking his photo. He was really furious and his friends (one of whom I'm pretty sure was Basquiat) had to calm him down. The thing is, I really wasn't taking his picture! I didn't even know who he was. I only figured out it was Warhol when I later saw his photo on the cover of one of my mom's art magazines... I was actually taking a picture of a garbage can. I told him that, but he didn't believe me... Well, I recently found that picture while cleaning out boxes from my parent's basement. I guess I should frame it and title it "Andy Warhol." Maybe I could sell it for lots of money?
