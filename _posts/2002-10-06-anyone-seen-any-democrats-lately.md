I usually don&#8217;t care much for Thomas Friedman&#8217;s opinion pieces in the Times, but every once in a while he hits the spot. This is one that I hope the Democrats read!


>   &#8220;What happened to the Democrats? Well, I don&#8217;t buy their whining that their voices have been cynically drowned out by Mr. Bush&#8217;s focus on Iraq. The problem with the Democrats is not that they are being drowned out by Iraq. The problem is that the Democrats have nothing compelling to say on all the issues besides Iraq. Iraq is winning control of the agenda by Democratic default, not by Republican design.&#8221;
