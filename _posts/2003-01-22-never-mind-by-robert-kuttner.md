>   &#8220;A friend who is a U.S. businessman based in the Far East recently called our attention to a right-wing outfit called New American Century. On the organization&#8217;s Web site (www.newamericancentury.org) is a manifesto dated June 3, 1997, that is absolutely chilling in its overreach. "We need to accept responsibility for America&#8217;s unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles," the manifesto concludes. Among the signers are Cheney and Rumsfeld. Suppose, said our friend, you substituted the word "Japan&#8217;s" or "Russia&#8217;s" for the word "America&#8217;s." How would we feel if some other country were hell-bent on making the world over in its image, for its narrow national purposes?&#8221;
