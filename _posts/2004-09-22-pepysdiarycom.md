In my <a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere', 'article']);" >article</a> on blogging, I commented on the links between contemporary blogging and diary writing in the seventeenth century:

> This is not unlike the situation in the 17th century, when political pamphlets and salacious broadsheets were the talk of French Salons and <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=2281736" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.economist.com/World/europe/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=2281736', 'British coffee houses']);" >British coffee houses</a>. The same period also saw the spread of new forms of private writing, such as maintaining a diary and writing letters, eventually resulting in the rise of the modern novel.

The site includes &#8220;annotations&#8221; which are user-contributed comments.

I found out about the site after following a link from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/22/history_of_blogging_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/22/history_of_blogging_.html', 'BoingBoing']);" >BoingBoing</a> to <a href="http://blogumentary.typepad.com/chuck/2004/09/blog_history.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogumentary.typepad.com/chuck/2004/09/blog_history.html', 'blogumentary.com']);" >blogumentary.com</a>, where someone has made a short quicktime movie about the history of blogging. Here is a <a href="http://blogumentary.org.nyud.net:8090/video/bloghistory.mov" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogumentary.org.nyud.net:8090/video/bloghistory.mov', 'cached version']);" >cached version</a> of the movie, in case the one on the site goes down.

UPDATE: More book and diary blogs <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/10/03/books-as-blogs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/10/03/books-as-blogs/', 'listed here']);" >listed here</a>.
