It seems that &#8220;<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2090114/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2090114/', 'has taken to likening the democratic prospects of modern Iraq to those of the early 20th century Philippines']);" >has taken to likening the democratic prospects of modern Iraq to those of the early 20th century Philippines</a>.&#8221; Interesting how the similarities play out:


>   The Spanish empire ceded the Philippines to U.S. control in 1898 after losing that &#8220;splendid little war&#8221; in the Caribbean. The American military then invaded the Philippines and took over the capital, Manila, in fairly short order. Then, as now, the troubles began. Here&#8217;s how Max Boot described the ensuing conflict in his book The Savage Wars of Peace: &#8220;[T]hough successive U.S. generals proclaimed victory at hand, American soldiers kept dying in ambushes, telegraph lines kept getting cut, and army convoys kept getting attacked.&#8221;
