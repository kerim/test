As the bankruptcy bill <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4857327,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4857327,00.html', 'passes in the Senate']);" >passes in the Senate</a>, with a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&#038;session=1&#038;vote=00044" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00044', 'vote of 74-25']);" >vote of 74-25</a> (Hillary Clinton abstaining because of her husband&#8217;s surgery). But the fight isn&#8217;t over yet. First of all, it goes to the House next month, before going to the president. Secondly, opposition is growing.

I think everyone was so distracted with Social Security, that they didn&#8217;t even see this one coming. <a href="http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/03/social_security.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/03/social_security.html', 'Which may have been the point']);" >Which may have been the point</a> of the attack on Social Security in the first place. But as people become more aware of the implications of this bill (see <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/09/bankruptcy-roundup/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/09/bankruptcy-roundup/', 'here']);" >here</a>), they are beginning to wake up. There is a new <a href="http://politology.us/archives/2005/03/bankruptcy_prot.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://politology.us/archives/2005/03/bankruptcy_prot.php', 'blogosphere-wide effort against the bankruptcy bill']);" >blogosphere-wide effort against the bankruptcy bill</a> which is growing fast. Stay up to date with <a href="http://politology.us/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://politology.us/', 'Politology.us']);" >Politology.us</a> and the <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/bankruptcy/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/bankruptcy/', 'TPM Bankruptcy Bill Blog']);" >TPM Bankruptcy Bill Blog</a>.

One question I have is, where was <a href="http://www.moveon.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.moveon.org', 'MoveOn']);" >MoveOn</a>, the <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ourfuture.org/', 'Campaign for America&#8217;s Future']);" >Campaign for America&#8217;s Future</a>, and other liberal action groups on this bill? Why didn&#8217;t they act sooner? Or did I just miss those e-mails?
