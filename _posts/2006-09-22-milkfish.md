A conversation while ordering dinner:

> Me: I&#8217;ll have the poached fish.
> 
> Waiter: Do you want milkfish or turbot?
> 
> Me: No, she&#8217;s not my wife.

Even in our native languages, we understand far less of what we hear than we realize. Try counting how many times in a day you say &#8220;What?&#8221; A lot of time we are able to compensate by piecing together what must have been said from the context. In fact, I would argue that one of the main features of the human brain is its remarkable ability to impose order on chaos. That is why we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_perception', 'see faces']);" >see faces</a> even in inanimate objects, and read meaning into inkblots.

Part of what it means to live in a country where the national language is not your first language is putting up with a lot more chaos. We simply don&#8217;t have access to the same tools necessary to recreate lost meaning. Even worse, those few tools we do have tend to be overused. For instance, if you learn a new vocabulary word, you are likely to hear it even when that isn&#8217;t what was being said. This is even more likely in a language like Chinese, which has so many homophones.

The above conversation make sense if you read what I wrote in May about learning the word <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/05/03/shimu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/05/03/shimu/', 'shimu']);" ><em>shimu</em></a> 師母 a formal term for &#8220;teacher&#8217;s wife&#8221; which is how everyone refers to Shashwati. That&#8217;s because the word for milkfish is *shimuyu* 虱目魚. The tones are different, one word has three syllables instead of two, and there is no reason for the waiter to have known I was a teacher &#8230; but I was at a conference with a colleague who had already once that day been mistaken for my wife, and I&#8217;d never heard of *shimuyu*, so it wasn&#8217;t a completely random mistake on my part. (It is also not unusual for people to assume that whatever Taiwanese woman I talking with at the moment is my wife.) I just assumed the waiter was asking if my colleague wanted to order dinner as well.

At least this time I understood the cause of my confusion. I probably have a hundred such encounters a day. And, when I think about it, I probably did when I was living in the states as well. The big difference here is that I am less able to recover from the awkwardness of the mistake, less able to use those strategies we rely upon to effectively frame the mistake so it isn&#8217;t noticed. Fortunately, laughter is always a good strategy for dealing with such situations, even if its at my expense.
