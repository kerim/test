Surly the idiocy of Bill Keller&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/05/opinion/05KELL.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/05/opinion/05KELL.html', 'column']);" >column</a> in the NY Times is obvious and I don&#8217;t have to refute it point-by-point? I mean, what can you say about a piece that ends with the claim that the problem with Rumsfeld is just that he isn&#8217;t nice to people? 


>   The lesson of this week&#8217;s intramural bickering, I think, is less about war than about management: when you run roughshod over people &#8212; whether allies or the general staff of the military &#8212; they will repay you in kind. I wonder if it&#8217;s too late for the war C.E.O. to take that to heart. ?Ç¬
