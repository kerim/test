Seymour Hersh, on the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,118955,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,118955,00.html', 'O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s show']);" >O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s show</a> (via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_05/003854.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_05/003854.php', 'Political Animal']);" >Political Animal</a>, emphasis added):

> O&#8217;REILLY: All right. Well, the damage to the country obviously is just immeasurable. But reading your article in &#8220;The New Yorker.&#8221; I just get the feeling that the Army, when they heard about it, started action almost immediately. It wasn&#8217;t a cover-up situation. Or did I read your article wrong?

> HERSH: This guy Taguba is brilliant. He could have made a living doing &#8212; it&#8217;s a credit to the Army that somebody with that kind of integrity would write this kind of &#8212; it&#8217;s 53-page report [NOTE: Full report available <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4894001/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4894001/', 'here']);" >here</a>.].

> O&#8217;REILLY: OK, but Sanchez the commander put him in charge fairly quickly. They mobilized fairly quickly.
> 
> HERSH: No, look, I don&#8217;t want to ruin your evening, but the fact of the matter is it was the third investigation. There had been two other investigations.
> 
> One of them was done by a major general who was involved in Guantanamo, General Miller. And it&#8217;s very classified, but I can tell you that **he was recommending exactly doing the kind of things that happened in that prison, basically**. He wanted to cut the lines. He wanted to put the military intelligence in control of the prison.

The *<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-intel5may05,1,422335.story?coll=la-headlines-world" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-intel5may05,1,422335.story?coll=la-headlines-world', 'L.A. Times']);" >L.A. Times</a>* picks up on one aspect of the report which has otherwise received little attention:

> A little-noticed portion of the military&#8217;s classified report on the abuse of prisoners in Iraq says that a number of jails operated by the 800th Military Police Brigade &#8220;routinely held&#8221; such prisoners &#8220;without accounting for them, knowing their identities, or even the reason for their detention.&#8221;
> 
> In one case, the report says, U.S. military police at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad shifted six to eight undocumented prisoners &#8220;around within the facility to hide them&#8221; from a visiting delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
> 
> &#8220;This maneuver was deceptive, contrary to Army Doctrine and in violation of international law,&#8221; the report adds.
