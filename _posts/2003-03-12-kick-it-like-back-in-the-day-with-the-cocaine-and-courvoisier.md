The Beastie Boys have released an <a href="http://www.beastieboys.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.beastieboys.com/', 'anti-war MP3']);" >anti-war MP3</a> you can download from their website. Here are my favorite bits:


>   Mirrors, smokescreens and lies <br /> It&#8217;s not the politicians but their actions I despise <br /> You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day <br /> With the cocaine and Courvoisier <br /> But you build more bombs as you get more bold <br /> As your mid-life crisis war unfolds <br /> All you want to do is take control <br /> Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold

>     &#8230;.Well I&#8217;m not pro Bush and I&#8217;m not pro Saddam <br /> We need these fools to remain calm <br /> George Bush you&#8217;re looking like Zoolander <br /> Trying to play tough for the camera <br /> What am I on crazy pills? We&#8217;ve got to stop it <br /> Get your hand out my grandma&#8217;s pocket <br /> We need health care more than going to war <br /> You think it&#8217;s democracy they&#8217;re fighting for?  </blockquote>
