Last October, Jim, of Uncle Jazzbeau&#8217;s Gallimaufrey, had a post about <a href="http://www.bisso.com/ujg_archives/000257.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bisso.com/ujg_archives/000257.html', 'linguists in movies']);" >linguists in movies</a> which sparked a lively discussion. This doesn&#8217;t quite count, but the actress <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005381/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005381/', 'Rebecca Romijn-Stamos']);" >Rebecca Romijn-Stamos</a> has been making the rounds on the talk-show circuit, promoting her new movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335121/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335121/', 'Godsend']);" >Godsend</a>. As usual, actresses are expected to have some funny story to share about their lives which they dutifully repeat on every talk show. Well, Rebecca Romijn [pronounced &#8220;Romaine&#8221;, like the lettuce]-Stamos&#8217; story is that her mother is a &#8220;linguist!&#8221; But that&#8217;s not the funny part (although it was for <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/anchor.jhtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/anchor.jhtml', 'Jon Stewart']);" >Jon Stewart</a> of the Daily Show). No, the funny part is that her mother went to protest the National Spelling Bee. That is because her mother is a member of the organization, <a href="http://www.spellingsociety.org/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spellingsociety.org/index.html', 'The Simplified Spelling Society']);" >The Simplified Spelling Society</a>, whose motto is:

It is pretty funny. I don&#8217;t think they had any press this year (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos said that only 5 people showed up to the protest), but their 2002 protest did get this nice article in the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/2002-06-12/feature.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.citypaper.com/2002-06-12/feature.html', 'Baltimore City Paper']);" >Baltimore City Paper</a>:

I mean, the metric system is much more logical too, and look how well that took hold in the United States. But the protesters are hopeful that the Internet will be a major aid in getting their ideas across. 

Maybe it will, but probably not in the way that they intended.
