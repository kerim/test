So I didn&#8217;t really appreciate Saturday Night Fever when it came out. But I just saw the movie again on TV, and it isn&#8217;t half bad. It kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0054599" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/Title?0054599', 'Pasolini&#8217;s Accattone']);" >Pasolini&#8217;s Accattone</a>. Like that film, the painful parts are somehow forgotten after viewing, and we just remember the fun parts.

>   The most lasting images are its joyous ones, of Tony strutting down a sidewalk, dressing for the evening and dominating the disco floor in a solo dance that audiences often applaud. There&#8217;s a lot in the movie that&#8217;s sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack.


Looking around on the web I just found out that the film was originally based on journalistic account of the real 2001 Odyssey disco club in Brooklyn by *New York* writer Nik Cohn. At first I thought &#8211; no wonder the story is so good, it is based on a real account of life in Bay Ridge. But the same Google search informed me that on the 20th anniversary of the film Nick Cohn <a href="http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,2190,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,2190,00.html', 'admitted to having faked the whole story']);" >admitted to having faked the whole story</a>:

>   The British writer describes how he went to Brooklyn&#8217;s now legendary 2001 Odyssey searching in vain for a flamboyantly dressed fellow he had spotted in the club&#8217;s entrance a week earlier. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t learn much&#8230;I made a lousy interviewer: I knew nothing about this world, and it showed. Quite literally, I didn&#8217;t speak the language.

And presented it as fact,&#8221; Cohn confesses. &#8220;There was no excuse for it&#8230;I knew the rules of magazine reporting, and I knew that I was breaking them. Bluntly put, I cheated.&#8221;

I guess he was just a good writer! Or maybe it was the screenplay writer, Norman Wexler who was also one of the writers for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0070666#writers" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://us.imdb.com/Credits?0070666#writers', 'Serpico']);" >Serpico</a>? He seems to also have been an interesting case. He was arrested in 1972 &#8220;by the FBI for saying he was planning to shoot then-president Nixon.&#8221; Well, it is certainly a better reason to be arrested than <a href="http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2003-07-17/rant.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2003-07-17/rant.html', 'reading a magazine article in a coffee shop']);" >reading a magazine article in a coffee shop</a>!
