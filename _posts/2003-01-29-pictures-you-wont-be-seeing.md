You can be sure when the next Gulf War starts we won&#8217;t be seeing many <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0212/pt_index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0212/pt_index.html', 'pictures like this']);" >pictures like this</a>.

Something to think about when you <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4592284,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4592284,00.html', 'read']);" >read</a> stuff like this:

That is, it is about oil &#8211; but not in the strictly economic sense of making Bush and his pals rich. If true, I continue to find it remarkable how *idealistic* so-called *cynical* conservatives really are. They, despite the history of similar plans throughout South America (**the** place to look for anti-US sentiment), still think that Democracy and Pro-US sentiment can be **imposed** from above&#8230;by bombs no-less. Now how foolish is that?
