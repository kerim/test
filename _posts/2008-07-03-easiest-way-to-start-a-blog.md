As an advocate for getting more anthropologists to take up blogging, I   
constantly keep an eye out for new technologies which will make this   
easier. Today I found what must be the easiest way to start a blog. 

Simply send an e-mail to: 

<a href="mailto:post@posterous.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','mailto','post@posterous.com']);" >post@posterous.com</a> 

And they will create a blog for you at [username].posterous.com, where   
[username] is the part before the @ in your e-mail address. (You can   
also login to their site and edit this or choose your own name &#8211; even   
add multiple e-mail addresses.) 

It really makes blogging as easy as it can possibly be &#8211; you can even   
attach photos and attachments.

Even this e-mail will become a blog post:

<a href="http://scrapbook.oxus.net/easiest-way-to-start-a-blog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scrapbook.oxus.net/easiest-way-to-start-a-blog', 'http://scrapbook.oxus.net/easiest-way-to-start-a-blog']);" >http://scrapbook.oxus.net/easiest-way-to-start-a-blog</a>

Cheers,
