> What if 3,300 Americans had died in car bombings, grenade and rocket attacks, machine gun spray, and aerial bombardment in the last week? That is a number greater than the deaths on September 11, and if America were Iraq, it would be an ongoing, weekly or monthly toll.

I would like to see *every single blog* link to <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109582366638394688" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109582366638394688', 'Cole&#8217;s post']);" >Cole&#8217;s post</a>. Maybe we can get through to a few people&#8230;.

UPDATE:
