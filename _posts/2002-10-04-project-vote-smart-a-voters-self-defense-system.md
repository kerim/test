If you look up your representatives on this web site you will get the best data I was able to find about their voting records on specific issues. You can look at their raw voting records, their response to a survey (if they chose to respond), and &#8211; best of all- a list of how different special interest groups rated them. Nothing like finding out that &#8220;On the issues the John Birch Society considered to be the most important in 2001, Senator Clinton voted their preferred position 5 percent of the time.&#8221;
