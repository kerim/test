It was my impression that Bush&#8217;s constant repetition of the phrase &#8220;the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time&#8221; in an effort to discredit Kerry during the debates would actually backfire, actually reinforcing Kerry&#8217;s message by repetition. So I&#8217;m glad to read Eric Bakovic&#8217;s <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001519.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001519.html', 'LanguageLog post']);" >LanguageLog post</a> which makes exactly this point:

> But was this strategy effective? According to George Lakoff, simply saying a word or phrase, whether you&#8217;re just quoting it or even flat-out denying it, does a good job of reinforcing the word or phrase itself &#8212; perhaps a better job than whatever it is that you&#8217;re really trying to communicate. As Lakoff put it in his recent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript330_full.html#lakoff" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript330_full.html#lakoff', 'interview']);" >interview</a> on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/now/', 'NOW with Bill Moyers']);" >NOW with Bill Moyers</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s like Richard Nixon getting up there and saying, &#8216;I am not a crook,&#8217; and people think of him as a crook.&#8221;

For the record, Bush repeated (some variation of) the phrase *seven times*.
