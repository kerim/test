I don&#8217;t often agree with <a href="http://www.tnr.com/etc.mhtml?pid=2043" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tnr.com/etc.mhtml?pid=2043', 'the New Republic']);" >the New Republic</a>, but I think they are dead-on when they say that

> any day in which Bush&#8217;s National Guard service is the dominant news story is a lost day for the Kerry campaign, since it&#8217;s a day Kerry can&#8217;t talk about the things that can improve his chances of winning, like Bush&#8217;s attrocious record in office.

Don&#8217;t let the Republicans define the agenda &#8211; even if it seems like it will look bad for Bush. It&#8217;s controlling the news cycle that matters, not the specifics of stories that happened thirty years ago.

UPDATE: Tom Tomorrow, as usual, <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2004_09_12.html#001746" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2004_09_12.html#001746', 'says it best']);" >says it best</a>:

> With the focus off Bush&#8217;s record and onto 1970&#8217;s typewriter fonts, Karl Rove couldn&#8217;t have planned this better if he&#8217;d tried. Which, for all we know, he did.
