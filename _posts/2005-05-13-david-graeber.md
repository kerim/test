From an article in <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=43&#038;ItemID=7834" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=43&ItemID=7834', 'Zmag']);" >Zmag</a>:

> [Anthropologist] David Graeber, was fired from Yale University a few days ago. Of course, that wasn&#8217;t the official explanation. The official one reads that &#8220;his contract wasn&#8217;t renewed&#8221; because of his lack of &#8220;collegiality&#8221;. If you would allow me to translate this: the &#8220;lack of collegiality&#8221; that David had showed was when *he was trying to defend his graduate students who were graduate union organizers*. 
> 
> Union organizers are regularly targeted at Yale. When one brilliant graduate student organizer was almost kicked out for clearly fabricated reasons, David Graeber was the only member of her committee with the courage to openly stand up for her at that committee meeting, and then later at a faculty meeting. On David Graeber&#8217;s behalf, Yale graduate students have initiated a petition which has been signed by almost all graduate and good number of undergraduate students of anthropology.
