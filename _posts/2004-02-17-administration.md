According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/17/opinion/17KRUG.html?ex=1392354000&#38;en=56910915b400e1d8&#38;ei=5007&#38;partner=USERLAND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/17/opinion/17KRUG.html?ex=1392354000&en=56910915b400e1d8&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND', 'Paul Krugman']);" >Paul Krugman</a>:
