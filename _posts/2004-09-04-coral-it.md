I&#8217;ve created a handy bookmarklet you can use to instantly get the <a href="http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/coral/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/coral/', 'Coral']);" >Coral</a> version of a link. This should allow even the smallest of web content publishers to post large movies, graphics, etc. and not worry about their webserver going down due to excessive traffic. Drag [this link][1] to your bookmark bar and, the next time you are looking at a movie, flash animation, or other media file you want to post to your blog, click the link and use the new URL instead of the site&#8217;s original URL. That way when people click the link they will be directed to a cached version of the page at one of Coral&#8217;s free servers, rather than the original page. You no longer need to worry about links going dead because they become too popular!

Spread the word!
