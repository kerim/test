[Washington Post][1]:


>   Asserting the same right of preemptive war that the United States used to justify its invasion of Iraq, Indian officials have accused Washington of failing to end Pakistan&#8217;s support for guerrillas in Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir and warned that India may be forced to take limited military action against its nuclear-armed neighbor.


[Guardian UK][2]:


>   Indonesia threatened yesterday to resume full combat operations in the province of Aceh, as new clashes between troops and rebels killed four people, putting yet more strain on a shaky peace agreement.

>   In other words, as the Dutch social scientist Henk Houweling puts it, &#8220;one of the causes of war is war itself.&#8221; Wars produce war-like societies, which, in turn, make the world more dangerous for other societies, which are thus recruited into being war-prone themselves. Just as there is no gene for war, neither is there a single type or feature of society &#8211; patriarchy or hierarchy &#8211; that generates it. War begets war and shapes human societies as it does so.
