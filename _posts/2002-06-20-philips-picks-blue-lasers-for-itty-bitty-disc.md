>   &#8220;Consumer-electronics giant Philips is demonstrating a prototype miniature disc drive that uses a coin-size disc capable of storing nearly twice as much data as a standard-sized CD. 
>   
>   
>     The drive uses 3cm discs that can store up to 1GB of data. Typical CDs, measuring 12cm in diameter, can hold up to 650MB of data. The prototype drive measures just 5.6 by 3.4 by 0.75cm&#8211;suitable for use in portable devices such as digital cameras, handhelds and cell phones&#8211;but the company is continuing to work to shrink the drive.
