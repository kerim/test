> A month before the alleged abuses occurred, she said, a team of military intelligence officers from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, came to Abu Ghraib last year. &#8220;Their main and specific mission was to get the interrogators &#8212; give them new techniques to get more information from detainees,&#8221; she said.
