First, a <a href="http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Sandwiches&#038;fid=7543" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Sandwiches&fid=7543', 'little background']);" >little background</a>:

> A cheese steak sandwich is not really a steak at all â€“ it is a sandwich made with chipped steak, steak that has been frozen and sliced really thin) and cooked on a grill top. Locals think in terms of steak sandwiches with or without cheese. Without cheese, the sandwich is referred to as a steak. With cheese, it is a cheese steak or cheesesteak. Cheeze Whiz is the topping of choice for serious steak connoisseurs. However, you can also use provolone cheese.

The cheese steak was supposedly invented by <a href="http://www.patskingofsteaks.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.patskingofsteaks.com/', 'Pat Olivieri']);" >Pat Olivieri</a> in the 1930s, although cheese wasn&#8217;t added till <a href="http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Sandwiches&#038;fid=7543" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Sandwiches&fid=7543', 'twenty years later']);" >twenty years later</a>.

The important point here is the cheese. As you see, the proper choices are &#8220;<a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/cheezwhiz/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kraftfoods.com/cheezwhiz/', 'Cheez Whiz']);" >Cheez Whiz</a>&#8221; or provolone. Here is a <a href="http://www.patskingofsteaks.com/cheesesteak.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.patskingofsteaks.com/cheesesteak.htm', 'picture']);" >picture</a> of the Cheez Wiz being added to a Cheese Steak. (To think that I actually used to eat that stuff&#8230;) That&#8217;s why Kerry caused a scandal when he (a product of summers in the Alps, I suppose) ordered his with Swiss Cheese! So, naturally, the Bush folks used this to their advantage, and ran an add where Bush <a href="http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0408/17/ip.01.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0408/17/ip.01.html', 'says']);" >says</a>:

> You know, this is my 32nd visit to your state since I&#8217;ve been president. A lot of people wonder why I&#8217;m coming so much. It ought to be obvious to you; I like my cheese steak Wiz with.

(Note: I&#8217;m not sure about this transcript. Is this supposed to be Philladelphia-ism? Maybe the <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000855.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000855.html', 'Philly-based LanguageLog folks']);" >Philly-based LanguageLog folks</a> can help out?)

Well, <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/08/liar.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/08/liar.html', 'Atrios informs us']);" >Atrios informs us</a> that Kathleen E. Carey of *The [Delaware County, Pa.] Daily Times* did some reporting on this and found out that Bush wasn&#8217;t being completely honest:

> She reported that Bush actually &#8220;prefers his steak absent of the usual Cheez Whiz and provolone, accompanied only by cheese of the American variety,&#8221; information that she obtained from her own Deep Throat, one Caeser Barnabei, the owner of the well-known cheesesteak shop, Jim&#8217;s Place. Barnabei, who has fed the Bush camp on previous swings through Pennsylvania and provided &#8220;70 to 80 hoagies&#8221; for the Bush campaign yesterday, confided to Carey that &#8220;the Jim&#8217;s Special is altered to whet the &#8216;W&#8217; appetite.&#8221;

OK, it isn&#8217;t in the same league as the <a href="http://nytimes.com/imagepages/2004/08/19/politics/campaign/20040820_SWIFT_GRAPH.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nytimes.com/imagepages/2004/08/19/politics/campaign/20040820_SWIFT_GRAPH.html', 'Swift Boat story']);" >Swift Boat story</a>, but I think Kerry shouldn&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/textpattern/index.php?id=874" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thudfactor.com/textpattern/index.php?id=874', 'sit there']);" >sit there</a> and let Bush get away with this!
