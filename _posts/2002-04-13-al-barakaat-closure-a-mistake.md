Did the US make a mistake when it closed down one of Somalia&#8217;s largest employers? The NYTImes thinks so: &#8220;Five months later, however, some United States officials now acknowledge that the evidence of Al Barakaat&#8217;s backing for terrorism is more tenuous. Some European countries that assisted in shutting down Al Barakaat say proof of a terror link has not materialized.&#8221;
