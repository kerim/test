At the NY public library they had a letter-writing campaign to try to restore $9.6 million cut (in addition to the $16.1 million already cut) from the city and state budgets.


>   Librarians claim that the budget proposed by New York governor George Pataki, which cuts library funding from $89 million to $75.6 million, will decimate service statewide. While education is being reduced 8.5 percent&#8212;something that has education advocates up in arms&#8212;libraries are being slashed 15 percent, which suggests they are being singled out.

However, even though librarians may be using traditional media, they are not using the internet! A search on Google showed up almost no hits on this letter writing campaign. I was only able to find this <a href="http://libraryjournal.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleId=CA280484&display=searchResults" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://libraryjournal.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleId=CA280484&display=searchResults', 'article']);" >article</a>. But I strongly urge you to write a letter to your representative asking them to restore the library budget!
