Heijin literally means &#8220;black gold&#8221; and is a Chinese term for corruption. It is also what I would have called a blog devoted to Taiwanese politics. Scott Sommers, who actually has a new blog on Taiwanese politics has decided to call his new blog &#8220;<a href="http://scottsommers.blogs.com/taiwanpolitics/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://scottsommers.blogs.com/taiwanpolitics/', 'Politics in Taiwan']);" >Politics in Taiwan</a>.&#8221; Anyone who wants to understand what&#8217;s going on with the current elections is strongly advised to go take a look.

I should say that while I agree with most of what Scott says about the KMT, I feel he can be a too uncritical of the DPP and their politics. They may not have as much Heijin as the KMT, but they certainly have a lot of it!

UPDATE: I just need to add that I don&#8217;t think Taiwan is anymore corrupt than any other democracy. In fact, I spent a lot of my time in Taiwan arguing with Taiwanese, trying to prove to them that New Jersey is more corrupt than Taiwan.
