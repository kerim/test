Shashwati and I are planning a research trip to London this summer (for <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com', 'the film']);" >the film</a>), and more than culture shock, we are preparing for price shock. When I go from Taiwan to NY I always feel that I&#8217;m being robbed at every meal, since you can eat for a week in Taiwan for what a Manhattan lunch costs &#8211; and I&#8217;m told that London prices are significantly higher than those in NY!

Well, at least I can console myself with this interesting discussion about <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/07/why_so_expensiv.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/07/why_so_expensiv.html', 'why the UK is so damn expensive']);" >why the UK is so damn expensive</a>. I&#8217;ll try to keep that in mind when I&#8217;m emptying my wallet out for lunch.
