*Taishang* is a composite word combining &#8220;Taiwan&#8221; and <strike>&#8220;Shanghai&#8221;</strike> &#8220;Shangye&#8221; (meaning business) [thanks to <a href="http://jonintaiwan.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jonintaiwan.blogspot.com/', 'Jonathan']);" >Jonathan</a> for correcting my mistake!] &#8211; it refers to Taiwanese businessmen who live and work semi-permanently in Mainland China. Most live either in Shaghai, or in Fujian province, across the Taiwan Strait. Many have &#8220;second wives&#8221; in China. According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/printout/0,13675,501040315-598582,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/printout/0,13675,501040315-598582,00.html', 'this article in Time Asia']);" >this article in Time Asia</a>, there are an estimated 1 million of them!

> The two economies are already irrevocably intertwined. Beijing encourages investment, hoping that closer economic links will lead to political reunification. Taiwan&#8217;s government acknowledges that some 50,000 companies from the island have invested $35 billion in the mainland since 1991. Some experts estimate the amount may actually total more than $100 billion if investments by offshore shell companies, set up by Taiwan businessmen to skirt regulations, are taken into account.

Here is how much is being invested (officially) each year:
