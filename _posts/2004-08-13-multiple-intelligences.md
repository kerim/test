I wanted to clarify a comment I left in <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000688.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000688.html', 'my post on Koko']);" >my post on Koko</a>, the guerilla whose learned to use symbols to communicate with humans. I wrote the following:

> I think both language and intelligence are really catch-all terms that cover a wide range of interrelated skills. So it isn&#8217;t a matter of animals standing somewhere on a scale at which Human intelligence equals a &#8220;10&#8221;, but rather they share some skills, lack others, and have yet others we don&#8217;t have. For instance, dogs understand a lot more about smells than we humans do. I believe they are also very aware of social dynamics. But does that mean that they can conjugate a verb? No. But that shouldn&#8217;t be the only test of &#8220;intelligence&#8221; either!

The idea that language consists of many different interrelated skills was developed most famously by Charles Hockett, who listed sixteen &#8220;<a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html', 'design features']);" >design features</a>&#8221; of human language. Each species of animal might have a form of communication which exhibits some of these features, but only human language possesses all sixteen of these features. (A shorter list of 10 &#8220;essential&#8221; features can be found <a href="http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/chimp/langac/LECTURE4/4design.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/chimp/langac/LECTURE4/4design.htm', 'on this page']);" >on this page</a>.) This is a useful list, although it makes one wonder if there aren&#8217;t features of animal communication which are not listed within Hockett&#8217;s list.

The idea that intelligence consists of more than just those human linguistic skills we value so highly comes from the work of Howard Gardner. Gardner&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm', 'multiple intelligences']);" >multiple intelligences</a>&#8221; are all very human, but I think it is possible to extend this model to account for various forms of animal intelligence as well.

I should mention here that Taiwan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.9year.org.tw/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.9year.org.tw/', 'new elementary school curriculum']);" >new elementary school curriculum</a> is very influenced by Howard Gardner&#8217;s work. While Bush&#8217;s <a href="http://nochildleft.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nochildleft.com/', 'No Child Left']);" >No Child Left</a> Behind (no, I didn&#8217;t forget to put the URL around that last word) policy is most certainly not.
