Here is a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/images/04/10/whitehouse.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.cnn.com/2004/images/04/10/whitehouse.pdf']);" >PDF of the actual document</a>, marked &#8220;For the President Only&#8221; and dated &#8220;6 August 2001.&#8221;

Read it for yourself.

Read it again.

I don&#8217;t see how any warning about the impending attack could have been clearer or more explicit than what I read here.

Maybe the real problem here is the part that says &#8220;For the President Only&#8221; *they really should have CC&#8217;d Dick Cheney*!
