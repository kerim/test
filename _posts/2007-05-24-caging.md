From an <a href="http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/05/24/justice-department-scandal-greg-palast/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/05/24/justice-department-scandal-greg-palast/', 'interview']);" >interview</a> with Greg Palast, where he argues that both the media and congress are missing the *real* story behind the US attorney scandal:

> [Monica Goodling] was trying to tell us something important, but the dim bulbs of the U.S. press and the committee dolts wouldn’t listen. She began by accusing her bosses of perjury. The issue was her allegation that they knew all about “caging.” And no one asked her one damn question about it. Like what is “caging” and why would they commit perjury to cover it up? 
> 
> &#8230; Caging works like this. Hundreds of thousands of Black and Hispanic voters were sent letters — do not forward. Letters returned as undeliverable (”caged”) were used as evidence the voter didn’t live at their registered address. The GOP goons challenged these voters’ right to cast ballots — and their votes were lost.
> 
> But whose letters were caged? Here’s where the game turns to deep evil. They targeted Black students on vacation, homeless men — and you’ll love this — Black soldiers sent overseas. They weren’t living at their home voting address because they were shivering under a Humvee in Falluja.
> 
> &#8230; Caging, by the way, is illegal. Law Professor Bobby Kennedy pointed out it violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — and I’d add, as a former racketeering investigator, mail fraud statutes. So [newly hired federal prosecutor Tim] Griffin’s a felon — now U.S. Attorney.
