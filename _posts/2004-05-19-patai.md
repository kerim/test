I&#8217;ve had to look fairly hard for anyone else in the blogsphere who is as upset <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/05/07/habouba/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/05/07/habouba/', 'as I am']);" >as I am</a> about the idea that there is something we can call *<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1578261171/ref=lpr_g_1/103-4550299-5056613?v=glance&#038;s=books" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1578261171/ref=lpr_g_1/103-4550299-5056613?v=glance&s=books', 'The Arab Mind']);" >The Arab Mind</a>*. (If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/001481.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://billmon.org/archives/001481.html', 'read here']);" >read here</a>.) Fortunately, <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/LanguageOfForce" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/LanguageOfForce', 'I am not alone']);" >I am not alone</a>. But it is not enough to point out that the idea is a racist one. The person who wrote the racist book deserves some examination as well. Here is what a friend of mine, who is a specialist on the Middle East, told me:

> Patai was not only an anthropologist, but also an Israeli general, who was the &#8220;mastermind&#8221; behind the divisive policies which Israel uses against the Palestinians.

I haven&#8217;t been able to find any more about this aspect of Patai on the web, but I take my friend&#8217;s word on it.
