Mark Twain, &#8220;The Mysterious Stranger&#8221; (1910). Twain had it right almost a hundred years ago. Sort of depressing, but encouraging as well. A must read!


>   &#8220;The loud little handful &#8211; as usual &#8211; will shout for the war. The pulpit will &#8211; warily and cautiously &#8211; object&#8230; at first. The great, big, dull bulk of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be a war, and will say, earnestly and indignantly, &#8220;It is unjust and dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it.&#8221;
