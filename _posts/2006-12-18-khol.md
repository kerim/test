I&#8217;d like to briefly link to two great discussions about the origins of Taiwanese vegetable names:

Prince Roy <a href="http://www.princeroy.org/?p=440" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.princeroy.org/?p=440', 'discusses']);" >discusses</a> the origins of the Taiwanese word for &#8220;cabbage&#8221; which is quite different from the rest of the Chinese speaking world. Here is a summary from <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002586.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002586.php', 'Language Hat']);" >Language Hat</a>:

> There is apparently a popular theory that the word \[高麗菜\] (which a commenter renders as &#8220;Gao Li Cai&#8221;) derives from the name of Korea, but much more likely to me seems the idea that it&#8217;s a borrowing from a Germanic language (cf. English cole, German Kohl)&#8230;

And there is this older post about &#8220;A菜“ or &#8220;<a href="http://toshuo.com/2006/the-a-vegetable/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://toshuo.com/2006/the-a-vegetable/', 'the &#8216;A&#8217; vegetable']);" >the &#8216;A&#8217; vegetable</a>&#8221; over at Doubting to Shuo, where it is generally agreed that it is of Hoklo (Taiwanese) origin.

Generally, when ordering dinner in Taiwan, one orders a &#8220;green vegetable&#8221; 青菜 and is given a choice between these two, as well as &#8220;cabbage mustard&#8221; 芥藍菜 (jièláncài), and a &#8220;water spinach&#8221; 空心菜 (kōngxīncài). The exact choice usually depends on what is fresh and in season. I&#8217;m good to go with any of them as they&#8217;re always tasty!
