The heat of Taiwanese summer could kill SARS if people just turn off their ACs!


>   Experts have estimated that the temperature range between 17?Ǭ?C and 26?Ǭ?C is the most favorable for the SARS virus. Taipei City&#8217;s average temperature in May is 26?Ǭ?C and in June the figure surpasses 28?Ǭ?C. High temperatures, coupled with effective measures adopted by the government and the public, are expected to rapidly slow down the epidemic next month. People should feel relieved.
