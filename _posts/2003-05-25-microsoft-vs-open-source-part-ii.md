>   Microsoft executives no longer call open source a &#8220;cancer&#8221; and a &#8220;destroyer of intellectual property&#8221;, at least in public. But, if anything, the firm has become more aggressive in competing with Linux. Last week, Microsoft was reported to have set up a special fund to pay for deep discounts on sales of Windows, to stop governments switching to Linux. &#8220;Under NO circumstances lose against Linux,&#8221; demanded an internal e-mail.

>     Microsoft has also, indirectly, aided a lawsuit that could hurt Linux. On May 19th, it said that it had licensed the rights to Unix technologies from SCO Group, a small software firm. Earlier this year, SCO sued IBM, which has made a big commitment to Linux, seeking damages of at least $1 billion for allegedly sharing its Unix intellectual property with the Linux community. SCO also sent a letter to 1,500 of the world&#8217;s largest firms, saying that they could be liable for their use of Linux. The lawsuit had seemed to be a ham-fisted attempt by SCO to get itself bought, or bought off, by Big Blue. But the deal with Microsoft lends credence to SCO&#8217;s claims and helps it financially to press them. If the case (in which, ironically, SCO is represented by David Boies, who led the antitrust action against Microsoft) drags on, it is likely to discourage a growing number of firms from using Linux.Microsoft executives no longer call open source a &#8220;cancer&#8221; and a &#8220;destroyer of intellectual property&#8221;, at least in public.
