B.L. Bhole, a political scientist at Nagpur University, is quoted in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/magazine/02HINDU.html?pagewanted=all&position=top" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/magazine/02HINDU.html?pagewanted=all&position=top', 'NY Times']);" >NY Times</a> about the R.S.S. &#8211; the Hindu Nationalists responsible for stoking anti-Muslim hatred in India:


>   &#8221;The R.S.S. can&#8217;t attract young middle-class people anymore, so they hope for better luck among the poor,&#8221; he said. &#8221;But the basic values the R.S.S. promotes are drawn from the high Sanskritic culture of Hinduism, which seeks to maintain a social hierarchy with Brahmins at the very top. The united Hindu nation they keep talking about is one where basically low-caste Hindus and Muslims and Christians don&#8217;t complain much while accepting the dominance of a Brahmin minority.

>     &#8221;The R.S.S. has been most successful in Gujarat, where low-caste Hindus and tribals were indoctrinated at the kind of schools you went to. They were in the mobs led by upper-caste Hindu nationalists that attacked Muslims and Christians. But the R.S.S. still doesn&#8217;t have much support outside Gujarat. This is a serious setback for them, and the only thing they can do to increase their mass base is keep stoking anti-Muslim and anti-Christian passions and hope they can get enough Hindus, both upper caste and low caste, behind them.&#8221;
