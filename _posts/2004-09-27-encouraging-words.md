Those of you who have gone through the hell of writing a thesis know <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=503" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=503', 'what I&#8217;m going through right now']);" >what I&#8217;m going through right now</a>. My oral defense is scheduled for 60 days from today. On top of that, I have to apply for jobs in an increasingly tight Anthropology job market.

So, I just wanted to thank two former Temple undergraduates who recently found me on the web and took the time to send e-mails about how much they still think about classes they took with me back in the mid 90s. Both of these students where worried I didn&#8217;t remember them. They might not believe me when I wrote back saying I do &#8211; but I really do. I also know that as a student we often think teachers don&#8217;t need words of encouragement from a student, but that&#8217;s simply not true. It really does help to be reminded why we put ourselves through thesis hell in the first place.

Thank you!

Now back to work&#8230;

UPDATE: The comic I linked to is actually the end of a several-part narrative which <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=499" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=499', 'starts here']);" >starts here</a>. There is also a &#8220;soundtrack&#8221; at the bottom!
