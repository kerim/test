<a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/lazywebtb.cgi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lazyweb.org/lazywebtb.cgi', 'Help']);" >Help</a>! I&#8217;m suffering from a plague of web sites I am unable to access. I&#8217;ve listed all the <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/precondition" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/precondition', 'offending sites here']);" >offending sites here</a>. Some of them are major sites &#8211; like <a href="http://wordpress.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/', 'WordPress.org']);" >WordPress.org</a>. Whenever I go to them I get the following message:

> Precondition Failed
> 
> The precondition on the request for the URL / evaluated to false.

I have no idea how to get around this. Other people seem to be able to access these pages fine. And it isn&#8217;t just my computer &#8211; all the computers in my house are affected. Is there anything I can do to solve this problem? From everything I&#8217;ve figured out so far it seems to be something wrong on the server end of these sites &#8211; but I seem to be affected more than other people. Perhaps it is related to TimeWarner Cable? Any cyber geeks out there able to explain what&#8217;s happening?

UPDATE: I&#8217;ve found a temporary workaround. I can access the sites listed above by using a <a href="http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html', 'free proxy server']);" >free proxy server</a>.

UPDATE: Someone helped me find the common denominator: All the sites I am having problems with are <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.textdrive.com/', 'hosted by TextDrive.com']);" >hosted by TextDrive.com</a>. Now I just need to figure out why their servers are giving me such grief.

(Time Warner Cable&#8217;s tech support was useless. They told me I must have a virus on my computer&#8230;)

UPDATE: TextDrive quickly contacted me to let me know that my IP was banned for some activity in February. Since I have a DynamicIP from Time Warner, it is likely that I was punished for something that another user did! Still, they were nice and quickly unblocked me. At least the mystery is solved!<!-- technorati tags start -->
