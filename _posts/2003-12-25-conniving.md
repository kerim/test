Hopefully Hispanic voters are smart enough not to let Karl Rove pull the wool over their eyes. But I was surprised that <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/005317.html#005317" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/005317.html#005317', 'TalkLeft']);" >TalkLeft</a> thought <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25882-2003Dec23.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25882-2003Dec23.html', 'Bush&#8217;s proposed immigration reforms']);" >Bush&#8217;s proposed immigration reforms</a> were a good thing, after so many other &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; moves by this administration. Then <a href="http://econ4dean.typepad.com/econ4dean/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://econ4dean.typepad.com/econ4dean/', 'Economists for Dean']);" >Economists for Dean</a> highlighted this key quote from the article, which shows just how cynical the policy really is:


>   The White House plan is being designed by Bush&#8217;s senior adviser, Karl Rove, in consultation with the domestic policy staff.


We all know that Rove cares deeply about the plight of illegal immigrants, and isn&#8217;t a scheming, conniving, political operator who is only concerned about election results. Or at least, I hope we do.
