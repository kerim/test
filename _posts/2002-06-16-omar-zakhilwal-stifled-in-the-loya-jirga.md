>   &#8220;The Afghan people have spoken clearly on this issue. I recently participated in a U.N.-commissioned assessment mission by the Center for Economic and Social Rights. Our report documents widespread agreement among all Afghans, from urban professionals to landless farmers, that there should be no role for warlords in the country&#8217;s future, and that international aid will be wasted unless the underlying conditions of peace and security are first established.

In a spontaneous display of democracy, they publicly rebuked two powerful symbols of Afghanistan&#8217;s violent past &#8212; Burhanuddin Rabbani, president of the mujaheddin government from 1992 to &#8217;96, and Gen. Mohammed Fahim, former intelligence chief and currently defense minister in the interim government.
