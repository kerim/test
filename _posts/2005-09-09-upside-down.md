Can anyone explain this?

<a href="http://www.bobharris.com/content/view/637/1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bobharris.com/content/view/637/1/', '']);"  title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/41729159_5b52464bc0_o.gif" width="400" height="400" alt="bushincompetencemap" /></a>

Make sure to read <a href="http://www.bobharris.com/content/view/637/1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bobharris.com/content/view/637/1/', 'Bob&#8217;s post']);" >Bob&#8217;s post</a> before offering any answers. For instance:

> I&#8217;ve received numerous emails explaining that all of the coastal parishes were already declared disaster areas because of Tropical Storm Cindy, which struck in June. Checking with FEMA&#8217;s own website&#8230; nope. Only five coastal parishes &#8212; Jefferson, Lafourche, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, and St. Charles &#8212; seem to be covered here, and only on a limited basis at that.

Bob even points out that systematic bias can&#8217;t explain things (race, class, etc.) so the only explanation on the table at the moment is incompetence&#8230;

I&#8217;ll post updates as the story develops. It is just too strange not to have some kind of rational explanation&#8230;
