>   President Bush, citing two trailers that U.S. intelligence agencies have said were probably used as mobile biological weapons labs, said U.S. forces in Iraq have &#8220;found the weapons of mass destruction&#8221; that were the United States&#8217; primary justification for going to war.


But the CIA seems to actually be far less certain than Bush claims. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002879.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailykos.com/archives/002879.html', 'Daily Kos']);" >Daily Kos</a> has good coverage on this:


>   Bush is walking around making absolutist claims about the nature of those vehicles. But once again, political expediency is trumping the actual intelligence. The CIA doesn&#8217;t claim anything more than that the trucks were &#8220;probably&#8221; bioweapon production facilities. For Bush to claim they are absolute evidence of WMD violations is yet another in a long, long list of LIES.
