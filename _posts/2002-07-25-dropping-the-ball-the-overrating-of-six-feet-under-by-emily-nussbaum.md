Pretty much how I feel about the show.  



>   &#8220;Six Feet Under may have won an outrageous 23 Emmy nominations, but it&#8217;s really just Ally McBeal in mortality drag: dream sequences, romanticized narcissism, fake-o self-conscious dialogue, meaning-of-life montages and all. The characters may be grown-ups, but the show isn&#8217;t about death and mortality at all; it&#8217;s about adolescence?
