>   &#8220;"U.S. Spied on Iraq Under U.N. Cover, Officials Now Say," a front-page New York Times headline announced on Jan. 7, 1999. The article was unequivocal: "United States officials said today that American spies had worked undercover on teams of United Nations arms inspectors ferreting out secret Iraqi weapons programs&#8230;. By being part of the team, the Americans gained a first-hand knowledge of the investigation and a protected presence inside Baghdad."
