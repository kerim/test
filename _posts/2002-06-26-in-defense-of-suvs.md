One concerned citizen recently left a photocopied note on my window chastising me for harming the environment, with no irony at all about the harm done by wasting paper and energy with this type of protest.

Its high profile allows for very good visibility on the road (yes, at the expense of those in smaller cars; I guess we could ban all trucks and buses as well).
