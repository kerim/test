> Last month, President Bush&#8217;s Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, called America&#8217;s largest teachers&#8217; union a &#8220;terrorist organization.&#8221;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because teachers and the other professionals who run our schools told the truth: the Bush team has failed to live up to their promises on education.&nbsp; Please sign our petition demanding that President Bush fire Secretary Paige.

> This is typical behavior for President Bush and his top officials.&nbsp; They say one thing&nbsp;&#8212; &#8220;no child left behind&#8221; &#8212;&nbsp;and do another &#8212;&nbsp;under-funding promises to our schools by $9.4 billion in the president&#8217;s latest budget.&nbsp; And when people dare to disagree with its policies, the Bush administration questions their patriotism and labels them terrorists in a time of war.

> Secretary Paige uses insults to defend the indefensible.&nbsp; Not only did the president break his promise to fund the reforms, his current budget calls for cuts in support for schools over the next five years.&nbsp; And he still wants to take billions from public schools to pay for private school vouchers.&nbsp; So Paige resorts to slurs: even in his supposed apology, he dismissed the growing teacher concerns as &#8220;obstructionist scare tactics.&#8221;

> We teach our kids that calling names is not the right way to win an argument&nbsp;&#8212; in fact, it&#8217;s usually a sign that you don&#8217;t have the facts on your side.&nbsp; Making our schools better is a tough job.&nbsp; We need a Secretary of Education who sees teachers and their representatives as partners in this effort rather than as enemies.&nbsp; Join us in calling on President Bush to find a better person for the job.
