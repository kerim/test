*Newsweek* has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6194092/site/newsweek/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6194092/site/newsweek/', 'a story']);" >a story</a> about Paul Bremer. It goes beyond his widely reported remarks regarding not having enough troops to discuss what many think was one of the most serious errors of the war: the decision to disbanded the army, driving many former soldiers into the opposition. A conversation supposedly took place between Bremer and his predecessor, Jay Garner, in which Garner tried to convince Bremer that this would be a bad idea:

> Garner then said: “Before you announce this thing let’s do all the pros and cons of this, because we are going to have a hell of a lot of problems with it. There are a hell of a lot more cons than there are pros. Let’s line them all up then get on the phone to [Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld.” Bremer replied: “I don’t have any choice. I have to do this.” Garner then protested further, but Bremer cut him off. “The president told me that de-Baathification comes before the immediate needs of the Iraqi people.”

His answer? Ahmed Chalabi.
