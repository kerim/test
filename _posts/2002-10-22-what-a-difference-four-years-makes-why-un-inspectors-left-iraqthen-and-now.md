This is an interesting list of quotes from four years ago and from today. It includes almost every major news source (NY Times, Newsweek, LA Times, CNN, etc.) Then they said that the inspectors were &#8220;ordered&#8221; out by the UN. Now they all say that the inspectors were &#8220;kicked out&#8221; by Iraq!!!

(Thanks to cursor.org for pointing this out!)
