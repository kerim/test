This is one of those &#8220;only in Taiwan&#8221; stories: Police in Hsinchu 新竹 <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2524647.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2524647.html', 'captured']);" >captured</a> an escaped convict when they noticed a man attending a police-sponsored BBQ.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival 中秋節 almost every Taiwanese family has a BBQ, sort of like the Fourth of July in the US. The practice has become so wide-spread that the Taiwanese EPA called it <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/09/21/123401/Mid-Autumn-Festival.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/09/21/123401/Mid-Autumn-Festival.htm', 'an environmental hazard']);" >an environmental hazard</a>.

> On the eve of last year&#8217;s Mid-Autumn Festival, October 7th, the EPA recorded a 45% jump in carbon monoxide pollution over northern Taiwan.

The criminal thought that the BBQ was &#8220;the last place police would have thought of looking for him.&#8221; Maybe it was the &#8220;eye-catching yellow windbreaker&#8221; he was wearing&#8230;
