I would like to retract <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000358.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000358.html', 'an earlier post']);" >an earlier post</a>. I suggested that the Democrats try to use &#8220;states rights&#8221; to re-frame the issue of same sex marriage. But in last night&#8217;s debate, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/2004/la-dems-debate-transcript,1,2676983.story" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/2004/la-dems-debate-transcript,1,2676983.story', 'Al Sharpton']);" >Al Sharpton</a> set me straight:

> I think is not an issue any more of just marriage. This is an issue of human rights. And I think it is dangerous to give states the right to deal with human rights questions.

So true. Sometimes it can seem politically expedient to trap the Republican&#8217;s in their own rhetoric; but, in the end, it is essential to rise above the fray. On this issue, by framing it as a human rights issue, Sharpton did just that.

What rights are associated with gay marriage? See <a href="http://www.nolo.com/lawcenter/ency/article.cfm/ObjectID/E0366844-7992-4018-B581C6AE9BF8B045/catID/697DBAFE-20FF-467A-9E9395985EE7E825" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nolo.com/lawcenter/ency/article.cfm/ObjectID/E0366844-7992-4018-B581C6AE9BF8B045/catID/697DBAFE-20FF-467A-9E9395985EE7E825', 'this list']);" >this list</a>. (via <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_atrios_archive.html#107765681031259857" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_atrios_archive.html#107765681031259857', 'Atrios']);" >Atrios</a>.)

NOTE: I don&#8217;t think the transcript here is complete. If anyone has the full quote of what Sharpton said, please let me know.
