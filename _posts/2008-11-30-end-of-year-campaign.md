Each year we raise $1000 to help fund the Chharanagar library. This library is much <a href="http://vimukta.org/2008/09/02/more-than-a-library/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vimukta.org/2008/09/02/more-than-a-library/', 'more than a library']);" >more than a library</a>, its a community center and an informal school as well. But its first and foremost a library &#8211; and a very good one at that! It houses a large collection of (mostly donated) books in three languages: English, Hindi, and Gujarati. 

We&#8217;ve already raised $700 towards this year&#8217;s goal. Please help us raise the last $300 before new year by using the widget below. Thank you!
