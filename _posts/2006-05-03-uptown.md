One of the things I love about riding the NY City Subway is how much individual personality each of the train conductors has. They each have different ways of announcing the stops, of telling people to get away from the closing doors, etc. The lack of standardization can be annoying at times, for instance, some conductors don&#8217;t provide vital information, others speak too softly, others too loud, etc.; but the human touch can really brighten one&#8217;s day when your late for work, jammed in a car with hundreds of strangers and no AC.

Take, for example, this quote from <a href="http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/archives/005299.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/archives/005299.html', 'OverheardInNewYork.com']);" >OverheardInNewYork.com</a>:

> This is an uptown C train. Transfer at this stop for the A train. Notice how I did not mention the E train. That&#8217;s because there isn&#8217;t one. Nothing, nada, zip, zilch, zero E train. If you&#8217;re going to Queens, get on this C train now and I&#8217;ll explain later.
