Just as Sherlock Holmes had his smarter brother <a href="http://www.sherlockian.net/world/mycroft.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sherlockian.net/world/mycroft.html', 'Mycroft']);" >Mycroft</a>, I have a smarter big brother as well: TF. Although not lazy and fat like Mycroft, he has so far been as reclusive. All that is about to change&#8230; Starting tomorrow, TF will be guest blogging here at *Keywords*.

TF lives in Paris, loves architecture, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/', 'Edward Tufte']);" >Edward Tufte</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea', 'bubble tea']);" >bubble tea</a>. It may come as a shock, but my brother &#8230; God, I can barely admit this in public &#8230; reads &#8230; the &#8230; *Economist*! There, I said it. Jokes aside, he is a truly independent thinker, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll come to find out.

I&#8217;ll be busy traveling over the next two months, and shooting a <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com', 'film']);" >film</a>, but I&#8217;ll continue to post when I can. I&#8217;ve also arranged for a few guest bloggers to cover for me over at <a href="http://savageminds.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/', 'Savage Minds']);" >Savage Minds</a>. They will be announced in due course.
