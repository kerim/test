Welcome to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident', 'the ranks']);" >the ranks</a>!

> A dissident is a person that actively opposes the established order. The term is most often used to refer to political dissidents, usually against oppressive regimes. Political dissidents usually refer to non-violent means, which can range from voicing criticism of the government to attempts to displace or overthrow the established government by achieving popular support and sparking a revolution.

> People should start investing money in independent record labels who have bands that sing about &#8220;sticking it to the man&#8221;. The only upside I see is that people get quite creative when they are oppressed. I predict a rise in counter-culture.
