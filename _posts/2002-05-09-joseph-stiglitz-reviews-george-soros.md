This is a very important commentary on the urgent need to reform the institutions of globalization. The former head of the World Bank, who has now become its most famous critic, reviews a book by George Soros, who has become an outspoken critic of the global financial system that made him so rich. 


>   &#8220;Seeking to explain what is wrong with globalization, and in particular with the international economic institutions, Soros, consistent with his non-utopian approach, looks in this new book for practical proposals, reforms that might reasonably be adopted. To be sure, he recognizes that there are forces that will work against these changes, that special interests in the United States benefit from the current arrangements. But he is a great believer in global civil society, and one of its strongest supporters.&#8221;
