This is interesting &#8211; look at how different the converage of the protests is in the NY Times compared to the Washington Post and the BBC. As usual, the NY Times buries the story. It made it to the front page (of the web site) &#8211; but it is practically hidden. The other two sources give it top billing with a photo.
