When I first came to Taiwan to teach, my colleague introduced me to a local purveyor of sweetened tofu 豆花 in the night market outside of school. This woman said to me: &#8220;Fu Jiaoshou 傅教授 [&#8220;Professor Fu&#8221; &#8211; my Chinese surname]? That mean&#8217;s you&#8217;ll always be Associate Professor 副教授 [Fu Jiaoshou]!&#8221;

The pun doesn&#8217;t translate well into English, and I hope it isn&#8217;t true (I&#8217;d like to be a Full Professor one day…), but when she said it I was only an Assistant Professor and I&#8217;m happy to say that, as of today, I&#8217;m truly &#8220;Fu Jiaoshou&#8221;!
