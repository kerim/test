>   &#8220;"Category Management" is the sexy trend for today&#8217;s mega-retailers. It involves asking one vendor to take over a section of your store and decide what you&#8217;ll stock there, so that the vendor not only chooses which of its products you&#8217;ll stock, but which of its comptetitors&#8217; products you&#8217;ll stock.&#8221;
