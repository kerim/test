An important new group blog has been launched. Here is a statement from one of the <a href="http://www.theotherindia.org/cities/peeping-out-of-the-metro.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theotherindia.org/cities/peeping-out-of-the-metro.html', 'inaugural posts']);" >inaugural posts</a> on the blog <a href="http://www.theotherindia.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theotherindia.org', 'How the Other Half Lives']);" >How the Other Half Lives</a>:
