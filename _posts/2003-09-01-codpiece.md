Back in May people were discussing how enlarged President Bush&#8217;s genitalia looked in his famous &#8220;Top Gun&#8221; photo-op. It seems that this was a result of &#8220;The former &#8220;fighter pilot&#8221; [being] <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/05/12_socks.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/05/12_socks.html', 'too stupid to release his parachute harness crotch straps']);" >too stupid to release his parachute harness crotch straps</a> as soon as he was on the deck.&#8221; Probably causing considerable discomfort. This came up again over on the excellent blog, <a href="http://corrente.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://corrente.blogspot.com/', 'Corrente']);" >Corrente</a>, which listed it as the <a href="http://corrente.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_corrente_archive.html#106208568805794641" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://corrente.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_corrente_archive.html#106208568805794641', '#9 reason &#8220;not to hate Bush&#8221;']);" >#9 reason &#8220;not to hate Bush&#8221;</a>:

Which brings us to the subject of this post &#8211; because some alert reader sent in a link to this hilarious <a href="http://www.onr.com/user/steveh/cods.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.onr.com/user/steveh/cods.htm', 'mock-history of the codpiece']);" >mock-history of the codpiece</a>. It points out that the word does not come from the fish:


>   In Middle English, &#8220;Cod&#8221; (or &#8220;Codd&#8221; in Old English, &#8220;Coddd&#8221; in Exceedingly Old English) meant &#8220;bag&#8221; or &#8220;scrotum&#8221;&#8230;


(I recall also reading something of the sort in Mark Kurlansky&#8217;s book <a href="http://isbn.nu/0140275010" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://isbn.nu/0140275010', 'Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World']);" >Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</a>.)
