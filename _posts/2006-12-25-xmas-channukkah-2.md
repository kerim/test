One of my students asked why Christmas was spelled X-mas? Here is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmas" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmas', 'Wikipedia']);" >Wikipedia</a> has to say:

> The word &#8220;Christ&#8221; and its compounds, including &#8220;Christmas&#8221;, have been abbreviated for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern &#8220;Xmas&#8221; was commonly used. &#8220;Christ&#8221; was often written as &#8220;XP&#8221; or &#8220;Xt&#8221;; there are references in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as far back as 1021 AD. This X and P arose as the uppercase forms of the Greek letters χ and ρ), used in ancient abbreviations for *Χριστος* (Greek for &#8220;Christ&#8221;), and are still widely seen in many Eastern Orthodox icons depicting Jesus Christ. The labarum, an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧, is a symbol often used to represent Christ in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian Churches

My students also pointed out that in Chinese there are two alternatives for Christmas: 聖誕節 Shèngdànjié (lit. &#8220;Holy Birthday&#8221;) or 耶誕節 Yēdànjié which more specifically refers to Jesus (耶穌 Yēsū). Until recently Christmas was a national holiday in Taiwan, but officially it was listed as being a day off for &#8220;Constitution Day&#8221; not because of the religious holiday. Of course, the fact that Chiang Kai-shek was christian and that the KMT government had major economic and political support from Christian groups in the US meant that there was a strong reason to have an official holiday on that day, whatever it is called. Even though it is no longer a national holiday (scrapped to make room for the five day work week), one can&#8217;t escape awful Christmas music (made even worse in local covers) when shopping in Taiwan as businesses have latched on to the holiday as a way to promote sales. And because most Aborigines are Christian, the Christmas spirit is especially strong here on the East coast.

On a related note, Language Log asks <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003959.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003959.html', 'how do you spell that Jewish holiday']);" >how do you spell that Jewish holiday</a>? I never realized there were so many options!

However you spell it, happy holidays!
