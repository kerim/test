> Whereas the English-speaking world was formerly perceived as a hierarchy of parent (Britain) and children (&#8216;the colonies&#8217;), it is now seen rather as a family of varieties. The English of England, the original source of all the <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/globalenglish/worldenglish/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.askoxford.com/globalenglish/worldenglish/', 'World Englishes']);" >World Englishes</a>, is now seen as one of the &#8216;family&#8217; of world English varieties, with its own peculiarities and its own distinctive vocabulary.

I just discovered, via a LanguageHat post on <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001280.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001280.php', 'Singlish']);" >Singlish</a>, that Wikipedia has a wonderful index of all the major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language', 'varieties of English']);" >varieties of English</a> (they use the term &#8220;dialects&#8221; which I have a problem with, since some of these varieties are not mutually intelligible).
