I was reading Daily Kos who reports that <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/archives/003930.html#003930" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailykos.com/archives/003930.html#003930', 'Clark is now second only to Dean on Meetup']);" >Clark is now second only to Dean on Meetup</a> (although Dean is still way ahead). But what is <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.meetup.com/', 'Meetup']);" >Meetup</a>?


>   Meetup is a free service that organizes local gatherings about anything, anywhere


When I saw this, I wondered &#8211; what about language practice? Sure enough, there is <a href="http://chinese.meetup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://chinese.meetup.com/', 'a page for Chinese Meetup']);" >a page for Chinese Meetup</a>, with 1564 members signed up around the world who meet on the first Sunday of every month to practice Chinese. Maybe I&#8217;ll go to one&#8230;
