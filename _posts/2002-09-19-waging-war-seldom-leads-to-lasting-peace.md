>   &#8220;Washington&#8217;s logic of force has failed in the Middle East and elsewhere. All three major American wars of the last half a century &#8211; in Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf &#8211; ended in stalemate or defeat. Yet Bush administration officials reckon more, not less, force is needed in order to achieve America&#8217;s goals. Contrary to international law, they are advancing a new doctrine of preemption that gives Washington the right to intervene anywhere it deems necessary.<br /> <br /> .<br /> <br /> By definition, however, unilateral actions are motivated by unilateral thinking and interests, and therefore do not produce universal solutions.&#8221;
