David Neiwert asks <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/archives/2004_02_01_dneiwert_archive.html#107609777829380997" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/archives/2004_02_01_dneiwert_archive.html#107609777829380997', 'why the Ricin attack didn&#8217;t put us on &#8220;Code Red&#8221;']);" >why the Ricin attack didn&#8217;t put us on &#8220;Code Red&#8221;</a>?

> The real problem, of course, is that for the Bush administration, it isn&#8217;t *real* terrorism unless it&#8217;s committed by brown-skinned foreigners. This isn&#8217;t simply a blind spot. It goes beyond even the underlying silliness of the whole &#8220;Code Alert&#8221; system. Ultimately, it is a problem directly related to the basic hollowness of our so-called &#8220;war on terror&#8221; &#8212; which is not a serious attempt to combat terrorism, but is instead, simply, a political marketing campaign at its core. A very, very costly one.

> Of all the people likely to produce a fair and thorough investigation of the WMD matter, Silberman should be last on anyone&#8217;s list. That he is now heading up this supposed probe tells us all we need to know in advance about its quality.
