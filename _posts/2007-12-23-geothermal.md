Speaking of Iceland &#8230; one of the coolest things about the country is how well they&#8217;ve used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Iceland" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power_in_Iceland', 'geothermal energy']);" >geothermal energy</a>:

> In Iceland, there are five major geothermal power plants which produce about 26% (2006) of the country&#8217;s electricity. In addition, geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements for around 87% of the nation&#8217;s housing.

I&#8217;ve always wondered why Taiwan doesn&#8217;t make more efficient use of geothermal energy, especially given the large number of hot springs around the island. According to a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2006.12.007" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2006.12.007', 'recent article']);" >recent article</a> on the subject, &#8220;Taiwan imports over 97% of its energy supply from foreign countries, mostly from the Middle East.&#8221;

Currently almost none of Taiwan&#8217;s renewable energy comes from geothermal sources, and renewable energy accounts for less than 6% of Taiwan&#8217;s total energy needs. And yet, other Pacific Rim countries, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan make much better use of geothermal resources.

There is some hope however, the Chin-Suei geothermal energy project in Yi-Lan County will generate both electricity and hot water. &#8220;The first stage of this project will be completed before 2006, and the project has planned capacity of 5000 kW, sufficient to supply electricity for about 1700 families.&#8221; Not much, but its a start &#8230;
