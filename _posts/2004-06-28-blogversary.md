Keywords is one year old today (June 29th)! Thanks to everyone for coming back week after week and taking the time to read what I write. Thanks to everyone whose left a comment or linked to Keywords from their own blog. Thanks to all the other bloggers out there who&#8217;ve given me such great content to write about. I believe it was Atrios who wrote that the reason he blogs is because &#8220;its better than yelling at the T.V.&#8221; It sure is!
