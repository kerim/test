It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that I was writing posts comparing Firefox vs. Safari. When Chrome came along I thought it would solve the problem, combining the best of both worlds and adding some nice new features as well. However, since Safari 5 came out I&#8217;ve noticed that my iMac functions much faster. This is strange, because I run apps to measure memory and CPU usage and Chrome was very good on both counts. It is true that memory usage is slightly better in Safari, but Chrome wasn&#8217;t so much of a memory hog that this can explain the difference. And Chrome seems to actually use less processor power than Safari! I suspect that OS X simply doesn&#8217;t like having too many processes running at the same time, and Chrome would spawn multiple new processes for each new tab. But that is just a guess. Another possibility is that Safari is even better at reducing its memory usage when it is running in the background? Whatever the cause, I hope a future update to Chrome will solve the problemâ€¦

The main advantages Chrome has over Safari are the &#8220;**omnibar**,&#8221; which I&#8217;ve come to prefer over having search and URL separated, **extensions**, which can now be enabled in Safari (and for which there are already a bunch of decent options, including AdBlock), and **keyword search**. Only in switching to Safari do I realize how much I&#8217;ve come to depend on Chrome&#8217;s keyword search feature. Without it I feel like I&#8217;m web browsing with one hand tied behind my back. There is an application, *keywurl*, which adds this feature to Safari, but so far it isn&#8217;t working with Safari 5. I tried the work-around on <a href="http://github.com/alexstaubo/keywurl/issues#issue/13" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://github.com/alexstaubo/keywurl/issues#issue/13', 'this page']);" >this page</a>, but I found it just caused Safari to crash&#8230; There are some other apps which provide similar functionality, but they don&#8217;t seem as good. I guess I&#8217;ll just wait and hope that the *keywurl* developer comes out with a fix soon&#8230;
