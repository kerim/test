I guess it was just a matter of time. <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.photoblogs.org/', 'Photo blogs']);" >Photo blogs</a> have been around for a long time already (I&#8217;ve even added one to my sidebar), as well as <a href="http://www.mp3blogs.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mp3blogs.org/', 'MP3 blogs']);" >MP3 blogs</a>, so why not <a href="http://www.vidblogs.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vidblogs.com/', 'video blogs']);" >video blogs</a>? I just had time to watch Chris Weagel&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.vidblogs.com/cgi-bin/public.pl?blogger=chrisweagel&#38;blog=21" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vidblogs.com/cgi-bin/public.pl?blogger=chrisweagel&blog=21', 'All Part of My Plan']);" >All Part of My Plan</a>&#8221; which I enjoyed. I&#8217;m still waiting for the tools that will make it as easy for me to quote a snippet of someone&#8217;s vidblog (or link to specific frame!) as easily as I can text. Someday perhaps us &#8220;text bloggers&#8221; will seem quaint.
