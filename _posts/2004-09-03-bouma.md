An excellent article about the various theories concerning how we recognize words can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx', 'here']);" >here</a>. Rather than blogging it myself, I e-mailed the link to Mark Liberman, who did <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001409.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001409.html', 'the heavy lifting']);" >the heavy lifting</a>:

> Larson explains that &#8220;[i]n my young career as a reading psychologist I had never encountered a model of reading that used word shape as perceptual units, and knew of no psychologists who were working on such a model. But it turns out that the model had a very long history that I was unfamiliar with.&#8221; His paper is an attempt &#8220;to review the history of why psychologists moved from a word shape model of word recognition to a letter recognition model, and to help others to come to the same conclusion&#8221;.

I myself had read many examples of the word shape model when I was teaching myself some basic typography skills, and have dutifully been passing on this misinformation to others, so I&#8217;m glad to be corrected.

As a bonus, Mark Liberman also links to <a href="http://www.raygirvan.co.uk/apoth/thought.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.raygirvan.co.uk/apoth/thought.htm', 'Ray Girvan&#8217;s weblog']);" >Ray Girvan&#8217;s weblog</a> about discredited scientific theories. (It looks like a great blog, but the Atom feed is not linked from the main site, and &#8220;auto discovery&#8221; is turned off in the template. However, it is a Blogger site, so I figured it had a feed somewhere. Sure enough, it is <a href="http://www.raygirvan.co.uk/apoth/atom.xml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.raygirvan.co.uk/apoth/atom.xml', 'here']);" >here</a>.)
