Busy, busy &#8211; so here is a roundup of posts worth reading:

  * George Soros <a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/textpattern/index.php?id=938" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thudfactor.com/textpattern/index.php?id=938', 'profits from Dick Cheney&#8217;s mistake']);" >profits from Dick Cheney&#8217;s mistake</a>.
  * Why Bush uses the phrase &#8220;<a href="http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/archives/000199.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/archives/000199.html', 'hard work']);" >hard work</a>.&#8221;
  * The *other*<a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/2672" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nysun.com/article/2672', 'Ralph Nader']);" >Ralph Nader</a>.
  * Is<a href="http://www.isbushwired.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.isbushwired.com/', ' Bush wired']);" > Bush wired</a>?

I should also add a little something about the debate. Most of what I have to say is well summed up by <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/003616.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/003616.html', 'Pandagon']);" >Pandagon</a>, especially regarding how awful the moderator was; however, I&#8217;d also add that I think Edwards gets some points for doing some very important things: (a) Making the point several times that there is no connection between Saddam and Bin Laden. (b) Making the links between Haliburton, Enron, off-shore tax havens, and Cheney. These are important points most Americans still don&#8217;t clearly understand and the more airtime they get the better. Cheney didn&#8217;t even try to defend himself on these issues &#8211; except for the mistake linked above.

I&#8217;ll add more debate related links to this post as I find them.

UPDATE: A nice article on the debate, which provides Edwards&#8217; <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/printer_100704Z.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/printer_100704Z.shtml', 'Haliburton']);" >Haliburton</a> quote:

> While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. They&#8217;re now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, they&#8217;ve gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it&#8217;s normally done, because they&#8217;re under investigation, they&#8217;ve continued to get their money.

UPDATE: Cheney <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/insomnia/487526.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.livejournal.com/users/insomnia/487526.html', 'caught lying']);" >caught lying</a> about not meeting Edwards&#8230; again!

UPDATE: More from <a href="http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&#38;pid=1878" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=1878', 'David Corn']);" >David Corn</a>.

> Cheney also jumped on Edwards for saying the cost of the war is $200 billion. He maintained it was $120 billion (as if that would be a bargain). But in Washington, the expectation is that the White House early next year is going to have to request at least $60 billion or so in funding for the war&#8211; which is money the Bush administration refused to place in the 2005 budget for the war. Include that money, and Edwards is more correct than Cheney.
