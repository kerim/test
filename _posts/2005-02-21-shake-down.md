Are Republican leaders trying to shake down the AARP so as to get concessions on social security &#8220;reform&#8221;? It sure looks that way. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay is now promoting the idea of replacing income tax with <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005692.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005692.php', 'a national sales tax']);" >a national sales tax</a>. Why is this a threat to retirees? Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_08/004499.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_08/004499.php', 'puts it this way']);" >puts it this way</a>:

> Suppose you make $100 today and it gets taxed at 20%. You have $80 left over and you put it in the bank. Tomorrow the income tax is abolished and a 30% sales tax is implemented, so you can only buy $60 worth of stuff with your $80. Your original $100 has essentially been taxed down to $60. For senior citizens, this applies to everything they&#8217;ve socked away over their entire lives.

Why wold senior Republicans be promoting such an obviously insane plan? The only reason I can think of is to scare old people. They can choose between supporting social security reforms that won&#8217;t be phased in until after they are long gone, or they can have double taxation effective immediately.

UPDATE: Also <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005693.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005693.php', 'see Kevin on how']);" >see Kevin on how</a> &#8220;the only way to eliminate a popular entitlement program is to gradually remove its broad based support,&#8221; and how &#8220;Private accounts are a Trojan horse designed to do just that.&#8221;
