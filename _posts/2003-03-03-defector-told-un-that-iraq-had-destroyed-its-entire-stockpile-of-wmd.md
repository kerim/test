>   On February 24, Newsweek broke what may be the biggest story of the Iraq crisis. In a revelation that &#8220;raises questions about whether the WMD [weapons of mass destruction] stockpiles attributed to Iraq still exist,&#8221; the magazine&#8217;s issue dated March 3 reported that the Iraqi weapons chief who defected from the regime in 1995 told U.N. inspectors that Iraq had destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and banned missiles, as Iraq claims.
