When I think of life in New York City, I think of the train I used to take every day. The train we heard in the distance from our bedroom window &#8230; the 7 train. You can see people reading newspapers in almost every language in the world on the 7 train.

The 7 train, which runs above ground in Queens, also provides a window onto the city. The *New York Times* today ran a great <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2005/09/08/magazine/20050911_PHOTO_SLIDESHOW_1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2005/09/08/magazine/20050911_PHOTO_SLIDESHOW_1.html', 'slide show']);" >slide show</a> about the views one sees from the 7 train. The photos were taken by Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao. Below is a detail from one of the photos (which is actually from under the train tracks):

Here in Taiwan we also hear a train from our bedroom window &#8211; the railway that runs from Hualian to Taitung. It&#8217;s a comforting sound &#8230; like home.
