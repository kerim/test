Here is a quote from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273875,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273875,00.html', 'FOX News']);" >FOX News</a>:

> Filmmaker Michael Moore&#8217;s brilliant and uplifting new documentary, &#8220;<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/about/synopsis/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/about/synopsis/', 'Sicko']);" >Sicko</a>,&#8221; deals with the failings of the U.S. healthcare system, both real and perceived. But this time around, the controversial documentarian seems to be letting the subject matter do the talking, and in the process shows a new maturity. 

And here is a <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/06/13/michael-moores-sicko-leaked-online/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/06/13/michael-moores-sicko-leaked-online/', 'quote from Michael Moore']);" >quote from Michael Moore</a>:

> Well, I don’t agree with the copyright laws and I don’t have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people. As long they’re not doing it to make a profit off it, as long as they’re not, you know, trying to make a profit off my labor. I would oppose that. But um, you know I do quite well and I um…I don’t know, I make these books and movies and TV shows because I want things to change, so the more people that get to see them the better, and um, so I’m, I’m happy when that happens, OK? Should I not be happy I don’t know? It’s like if a friend of yours has the DVD of my movie, gave it to you to watch one night, is that person doing something wrong? I’m not seeing any money from that. But he’s just handing the DVD to you so that you can watch my movie. A DVD that he bought, but you’re not buying it, yet you’re watching it without paying me any money. See I think that’s OK, and it’s always been OK, we share things with people. And I think information and art, ideas should be shared. 

Enough said.
