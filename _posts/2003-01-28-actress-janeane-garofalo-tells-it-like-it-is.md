>   JANEANE GAROFALO, ACTRESS: Thank you. <br /> KURTZ: You&#8217;ve been all over the tube, from &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; to CNN, MSNBC, Fox, speaking out against war with Iraq. Are the anchors taking you seriously, or are you just the entertainment?

>     GAROFALO: No, I don&#8217;t think that they are taking me too seriously. I think they use actors to marginalize the anti-war movement. They have them on, and then sort of are slightly condescending.

>     KURTZ: That they [the Network News] want a war? That they want a war so they can exploit it as a dramatic story? You&#8217;re not suggesting that, are you?

>     GAROFALO: Oh, am I suggesting that? I guess I am suggesting that. I guess I am saying, actually, they&#8217;re pro-ratings. They&#8217;re pro-easily-packaged-stories. They&#8217;re pro-sensational-headlines. They&#8217;re pro-ratings grabbers. They like their graphics.

>     You know, there are anchors that sometimes put in a voice of dissent occasionally. Also dissent is not a dirty word. But I would say for the most part it&#8217;s not a very open debate. You have anchors saying all the time, well, we know Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. No, we don&#8217;t. We do not. We do not know that. So&#8230;
