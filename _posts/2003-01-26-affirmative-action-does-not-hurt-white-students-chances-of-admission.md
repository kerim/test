>   &#8220;But overall, the trend is clear: at combined SAT scores of 1300 and above, the presence or absence of affirmative action makes no significant difference at all to the odds of a white student being admitted. At lower scores, the difference exists, but is tiny. A white student with a combined score below 100 has a 96.7% chance of rejection from a selective school with affirmative action, and a 93.3% chance of rejection if aa didn&#8217;t exist. In either case, the odds are overwhelming she&#8217;ll be rejected; and the primary reason for the rejection is her poor SATs, not her race.&#8221;
