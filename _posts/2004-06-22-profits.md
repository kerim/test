Nathan Newman has an <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001769.shtml#001769" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001769.shtml#001769', 'excellent post']);" >excellent post</a> about the reality behind the &#8220;economic recovery.&#8221; First, he quotes from *<a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2749545" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2749545', 'The Economist']);" >The Economist</a>*:

> &#8230; for many Americans the economy does not seem so wonderful. The fruits of this recovery, thus far, have been more evident in firms&#8217; profits than in workers&#8217; wages. As a share of GDP, wages are at their lowest level in decades.

Then he provides us with this handy chart from the <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_05272004" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_05272004', 'Economic Policy Institute']);" >Economic Policy Institute</a>, showing exactly what this means:
