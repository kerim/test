Believe it or not, I was actually given a rubber stamp so that I can rubber stamp all the ridiculous paperwork that we have to deal with. Some memos are deemed too important to just e-mail to faculty. Instead, we have to go every day or two to the departmental office and officially stamp a form with our chop certifying that we read the memo.

Not being a native speaker it took me a lot of time to figure out that there was actually nothing important in the memos. So now I&#8217;ve asked the department&#8217;s wonderfully helpful administrative assistant to notify me if there is anything important. The rest will be rubber stamped!

I also had to set up a filter on my mail server to forward all the university-wide announcements to my Gmail account.

Below is a picture of my new stamp and a test sheet of paper.
