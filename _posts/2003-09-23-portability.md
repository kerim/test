>     <b>That&#8217;s about to change</b>. On November 24, after four years of industry delay, cell phone carriers will be required to let you take your phone number with you when you switch carriers. It&#8217;s called number portability and it&#8217;s a big deal because consumers will likely see lower prices and better service as companies try harder to attract &#8211; or keep &#8211; business.

Worse, at the same time they are trying to stop number portability, most cell phone companies are busy collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in number portability fees on cell phone bills.
