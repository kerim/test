I was contemplating purchasing a laser printer from a company called <a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.legendmicro.com/', 'Legend Micro']);" >Legend Micro</a> &#8211; until I read <a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/warranty.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.legendmicro.com/warranty.asp', 'their return policy']);" >their return policy</a>.

> Return Policy
> 
> In order to remain competitive in todayâ€™s marketplace and continue to provide exceptional service to its customers, Legend Micro is instituting a new 100% Product Satisfaction Policy effective October 1, 2003:
> 
> 1. 15 Day 100% Money Back Guaranty for retail and mail order customers.

Sounds great, doesn&#8217;t it? But read the list of excluded items (emphasis added):

> **Absolutely no refunds** on processors, memory chips, LCD monitors, notebooks, **printers**, fax machines and software

That seems to cover a pretty large swath of their product line. I thought there must be some mistake, so I e-mailed them. No reply. So then I called them. Michael informed me that &#8220;every agreement always has two sides&#8221; &#8211; yes it does: suckers and profiteers.
