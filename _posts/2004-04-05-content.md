> The <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2004_04_04_archive.asp#108111343851793010" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2004_04_04_archive.asp#108111343851793010', 'Academy of Art University here in San Francisco']);" >Academy of Art University here in San Francisco</a> &#8211; the biggest art school in the country &#8211; recently expelled a student for writing a violent short story, and then fired his instructor for teaching a story by David Foster Wallace the administration also found offensive.
> 
> As this story broke in the press the school has responded by announcing stringent policies regarding the content of students&#8217; artwork (writing, visual art, film, video game design, etc.), what can be taught in the classroom, and who is allowed to speak on campus.&#160; This was brought home to me when an instructor at the college invited me to speak to his class (along with the fired teacher and a representative of the First Amendment Project) and I was physically barred from entering the building.
