This December, <a href="http://blog.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.shashwati.com/', 'Shashwati']);" >Shashwati</a> and I are going to India to shoot a documentary film about the residents of one city&#8217;s slum who are using **theatre** to fight back against decades of prejudice and police oppression.

<a href="http://dnt.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dnt.shashwati.com/', 'Help us tell their story.']);" >Help us tell their story.</a>

Even though we are paying our own way to India, **we need to raise $15,000** to cover expenses for the shoot: transportation in India, accommodation, salaries for the people who will help us on the shoot, equipment rentals, etc. We&#8217;ve already raised $3,000, but we need to do much more.

I wrote about <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/07/dnt/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/01/07/dnt/', 'the people of Chharanager']);" >the people of Chharanager</a> after our last trip. You can read more about the film, the people and organizations involved, and how to give money, or <a href="http://dnt.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dnt.shashwati.com/', 'the film&#8217;s web site']);" >the film&#8217;s web site</a>. And here is my Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kerim/sets/167881/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/kerim/sets/167881/', 'photo gallery']);" >photo gallery</a> of Chharanager pics.

Thank you.
