>   Ledeen&#8217;s ideas are repeated daily by such figures as Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz. His views virtually define the stark departure from American foreign policy philosophy that existed before the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001. He basically believes that violence in the service of the spread of democracy is America&#8217;s manifest destiny. Consequently, he has become the philosophical legitimator of the American occupation of Iraq.


And now he wants to go to war on Syria, Iran, and Lebanon.
