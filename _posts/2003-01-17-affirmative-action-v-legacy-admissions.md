This Blog is one of the few sites to really cover the Affirmative Action issue (the news certainly hasn&#8217;t) &#8211; but see the many good articles linked from this page!


>   &#8220;But as you can see from the article above, the legacy admissions rate here at Harvard is ridiculous&#8211;40 percent of legacy students get admitted. When you consider that the general acceptance rate is something like only 11 percent, that number starts to smell funny&#8230; And it gets worse when you note that "only 7.6% of legacy applicants accepted last year were black, Hispanic or Native American, compared with 17.8% of all successful applicants."&#8221;
