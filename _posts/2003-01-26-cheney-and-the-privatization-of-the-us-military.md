This is an interesting LA Times article on Cheney&#8217;s links to the company that is one of the largest contractors of an increasingly privatized US military.


>   &#8220;Vice President Dick Cheney was defense secretary when the first Brown & Root study was done, and he became chief executive of its parent company, Halliburton, when he retired, providing fodder for privatization&#8217;s critics and conspiracy theorists. Through the 1990s, Brown & Root&#8217;s military business grew exponentially, but a company spokesperson, saying that had nothing to do with the Cheney connection, noted that Brown & Root has been doing extensive government work since the 1940s.&#8221;
