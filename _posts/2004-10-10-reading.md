<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/', 'Kevin Drum']);" >Kevin Drum</a> points to two very important articles (actually four, since the second one contains three parts). These are both really worth your time, and I don&#8217;t have anything to add beyond Kevin&#8217;s excellent posts, so I&#8217;ll just briefly cite him:

<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004889.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004889.php', 'First']);" >First</a>, there is the *LA Times&#8217;* article &#8220;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-riskshift3oct10,1,5915831,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-riskshift3oct10,1,5915831,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines', 'If America Is Richer, Why Are Its Families So Much Less Secure?']);" >If America Is Richer, Why Are Its Families So Much Less Secure?</a>&#8221;

> Although volatility remained high in the late 1990s, with typical annual swings of as much as 27%, incomes finally began to grow again, improving families&#8217; odds of being able to get ahead. But the good times didn&#8217;t last. Since 2000, incomes have reversed course and fallen about 1% a year, according to recently released census figures. In other words, things are back to the unattractive equation of more risk for less reward.

> about how Republicans have abused their majority position in Congress to rule the legislative process in the House with an increasingly iron — and often corrupt — fist. Backroom deals, closed debates, abuse of legislative traditions, and procedural skullduggery are now the rule rather than the exception.
