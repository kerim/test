Two items from the blogsphere that seem to sum up the Bush administration&#8217;s attitude towards the budget:

First, via <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2003_09_07.html#001044" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2003_09_07.html#001044', 'Tom Tomorrow']);" >Tom Tomorrow</a>, <a href="http://www.billmon.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.billmon.org/', 'Billmon&#8217;s']);" >Billmon&#8217;s</a> concise version of Bush&#8217;s speech:


>   &#8220;Iraq is now the central front in the global war against absolute evil, but it&#8217;s not so important that we have to roll back any of my tax cuts, send more U.S. troops to Iraq or do anything else that might make swing voters slightly less likely to vote for me next year. Thank you and God Bless America.&#8221;


Then, <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_atrios_archive.html#106311509312093010" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_atrios_archive.html#106311509312093010', 'via Atrios']);" >via Atrios</a>, a graph of Bush&#8217;s larger discretionary budget items. Notice the tax cuts at the bottom!
