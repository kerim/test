Regarding Harriet Miers, who was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100300252.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100300252.html', 'picked by Bush']);" >picked by Bush</a> to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor on the Supreme Court, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said:

> She&#8217;s a woman who understands judicial restraint.

And that about sums it up &#8211; they needed a woman or a minority, but they needed one who &#8216;knows her place&#8217; &#8230;

> If confirmed by the Senate, Miers would be a rare appointee with no experience as a judge at any level. Initial searches of news archives also suggested that Miers has not been an outspoken advocate for or against any particular issue.

Or it could be that Bush is just rewarding his cronies with high level appointments instead of dinky ambassadorships. As new CPB president Patricia Harrison said of her appointment (according to <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/30/1411221" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/30/1411221', 'Celia Wexler']);" >Celia Wexler</a>):

> “Gee, it&#8217;s great I don&#8217;t have to leave the country,” with the implication being, well, you know, you give a lot, maybe you get to be an ambassador, but this is even better, because you know, I get to be on the CPB board and I can stay at home.

UPDATE: Maybe she won&#8217;t be <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007251.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_10/007251.php', 'quite so restrained']);" >quite so restrained</a> after all&#8230;
