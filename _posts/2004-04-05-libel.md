It isn&#8217;t news that, despite their racy tabloids, the Brits have less freedom of speech than we do in the United States. Well, formally anyway. I suppose it is arguable that the Brits have a greater diversity of ideas &#8211; although I haven&#8217;t seen anyone actually make this argument; but there are regularly stories about books not being published in England because of official censorship. <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/edit/archives/2004/04/04/2003116647" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/edit/archives/2004/04/04/2003116647', 'This story']);" >This story</a>, however, is different, in that it is about a publisher not publishing a book for reasons that sound positively American &#8211; fear of frivolous law suits:

> The UK libel system, he said is &#8220;stifling legitimate freedom of speech&#8221;.

The book is *House of Bush, House of Saud*, by the American writer Craig Unger.
