Niall Ferguson: This guy is all over the place &#8211; the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/magazine/27EMPIRE.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/magazine/27EMPIRE.html', 'New York Times']);" >New York Times</a>, the New York Review of Books, etc. and now he has a new book, Empire, which seems to be an apology for British Colonialism. I had to spend about an hour on the internet before I could find even one critical review of him, but at last I <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,891477,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,891477,00.html', 'succeeded']);" >succeeded</a>:


>   Niall Ferguson is the Leni Riefenstahl of George Bush&#8217;s new imperial order. Just as Riefenstahl&#8217;s photography glorified the violence of fascism and sold it to the middle classes, Ferguson&#8217;s Channel 4 series and book on the British empire presents the acceptable face of imperial brutality.


A less critical review, but also worth reading, is <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2003/04/17/ferguson/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2003/04/17/ferguson/index.html', 'this one']);" >this one</a> in Salon:


>   So salutary was the British Empire&#8217;s effect on history that Ferguson suggests the world would do well to get itself another essentially &#8220;good&#8221; empire to maintain order. The good empire he&#8217;s talking about is the United States.


But with the amount of press this guy is getting, we need more critical reviews out there, if only to combat <a href="http://cryptome.sabotage.org/empire-shy.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://cryptome.sabotage.org/empire-shy.htm', 'this kind']);" >this kind</a> of offensive garbage:


>   And when that challenge came, its subject peoples rallied to the empire&#8217;s defense. Gandhi&#8217;s &#8220;Quit India&#8221; campaign of 1942 collapsed after a few weeks, but more than two million Indians served in the British forces, 250,000 of them outside India. Their loyalty signified something important: Most subjects of the king had never been better governed than by the young men of the Indian Civil Service and the Colonial Office.
