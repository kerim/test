The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_%28disambiguation%29" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity_%28disambiguation%29', 'disambiguation page']);" >disambiguation page</a> for &#8220;synchronicity&#8221; lists one of the meanings as &#8220;A goal or result of synchronization.&#8221; I mention this just so you aren&#8217;t expecting me to talk about anything exciting here, like Jungian psychoanalysis &#8230; This is just a boring post about how I&#8217;ve figured out ways of syncing my laptop and my new iMac in my office without purchasing an expensive .Mac subscription. Having a second computer is a blessing of sorts &#8211; I don&#8217;t need to cary a laptop on my bike everyday, but it also creates new challenges with data being created on two systems.

What do I need to sync? Most important is e-mail, followed by my iCal calendars, AddressBook, to-do lists, web browser and rss reader content, my internet passwords, and any files I happen to be working on at the moment. Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m handling each of these challenges:

(NOTE: Although I mentioned an iMac, many of these solutions are cross platform. I&#8217;ve highlighted those solutions which are Mac-only)

1. E-mail. That&#8217;s easy. I use IMAP instead of POP. My IMAP server of choice is <a href="http://luxsci.com/affiliate.php/la-129052/index.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://luxsci.com/affiliate.php/la-129052/index.htm', 'Luxsci']);" >Luxsci</a>, which has never let me down in all the year&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been using it. Tech support has always been reliable and nearly instant. <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fastmail.fm/', 'Fastmail.fm']);" >Fastmail.fm</a> is cheaper, and has a nicer webmail interface, but I&#8217;m happy with Lusxsci and don&#8217;t want to mess with a good thing.

2. For my iCal calendars I have a two part solution. First, I have a WebDav drive courtesy of my lifetime account with <a href="http://textdrive.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://textdrive.com/', 'TextDrive']);" >TextDrive</a>. Second, I use a neat tool called <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11419" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11419', 'iSynCal']);" >iSynCal</a> [Mac-Only] to synchronize my calendars with my WebDav drive. So far I&#8217;ve encountered a few hiccups setting it up, but it seems to work well and the developer is very responsive.

3. For my AddressBook I use <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.plaxo.com/', 'Plaxo']);" >Plaxo</a> which I&#8217;ve been quite happy with.

4. For to-do lists there are lots of choices these days. I could just use iCal&#8217;s to-do lists, but I need some more flexibility. Up till now I&#8217;ve been considering <a href="http://kinkless.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kinkless.com/', 'Kinkless GTD']);" >Kinkless GTD</a> [Mac-Only], but that isn&#8217;t very good for syncing between computers. I also don&#8217;t see any other reason to fork out money for <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/beta/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/beta/', 'OmniOutliner Pro']);" >OmniOutliner Pro</a> [Mac-Only] when I already have the basic version. [NOTE: <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.omnigroup.com/', 'Omni']);" >Omni</a> is working on a dedicated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done', 'GTD']);" >GTD</a> solution which should be quite nice when it comes out.] I could save it on my WebDav or JungleDisc (see below), but I&#8217;m also not crazy about how Kinkless requires constant manual syncing. A better solution seems to be something online. <a href="http://www.zenlist.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zenlist.com/', 'Zenlist.com']);" >Zenlist.com</a> looks great, but the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/', 'software']);" >software</a> it uses is still lacking a lot of features, like hierarchical to-do lists which I consider a must. I also don&#8217;t drink the GTD kool-aid, especially since the very concept of &#8220;contexts&#8221; is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/31/simplify-contexts/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/31/simplify-contexts/', 'nearly useless']);" >nearly useless</a> when you are always in front of your computer. The best option right now looks like <a href="http://kingdesign.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kingdesign.net/', 'Tasks']);" >Tasks</a> from <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://alexking.org/blog/', 'Alex King']);" >Alex King</a>. I prefer desktop applications to online ones, but until Omni releases their dedicated task management program Tasks looks like the best bet.

5. <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/', 'Google Browser Sync']);" >Google Browser Sync</a> for Firefox is very reliable for keeping my open web pages, bookmarks, cookies, etc. in sync. But for some reason it always ignores the fact that I have Gmail open! <a href="http://del.icio.us" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us', 'Del.icio.us']);" >Del.icio.us</a> is also very useful when browsing on multiple computers and browsers &#8211; especially now that you can keep some things private. The <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension', 'Del.icio.us Firefox extension']);" >Del.icio.us Firefox extension</a> is pretty good, but I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/21686" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/21686', 'WebNoteHappy']);" >WebNoteHappy</a> [Mac-Only] which is looking very promising.

6. <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/10350" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/10350', 'NetNewsWire']);" >NetNewsWire</a> [Mac-Only] now offers excellent synchronization features via <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newsgator.com/', 'NewsGator']);" >NewsGator</a>.

7. I&#8217;m still stuck looking for a good password syncing solution. I use <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/4362" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/4362', 'PasswordWallet']);" >PasswordWallet</a> [Mac-Only] for my important stuff, like bank accounts, and <a href="http://passwordmaker.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://passwordmaker.org/', 'Password Maker']);" >Password Maker</a> for less important stuff &#8211; but neither seems well suited for synchronization across computers. (Although PasswordWallet does sync well with my Treo.) I guess synchronization doesn&#8217;t mix well with security concerns.

8. For the rest of my stuff, like files I&#8217;m working on on both computers, I use <a href="http://jungledisk.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jungledisk.com/', 'Jungle Disk']);" >Jungle Disk</a>. This could potentially solve some problems with syncing other things, like my to-do list and my passwords, but the added step of syncing between local and remote drives does make life more complicated and I&#8217;m trying to simplify. Several new online tools also allow you to work on the same document from multiple locations. I&#8217;m particularly fond of <a href="http://www.writely.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.writely.com/', 'Writely']);" >Writely</a>, which I&#8217;ve been using a lot lately &#8211; but I think it is mostly useful for collaborative projects.

That&#8217;s my list. If you have any other tips or tricks for achieving true synchronicity, let me know!

UPDATE: iSynCal is just too complex and resource intensive for me. I paid for it, and the devleoper is great, but I think I&#8217;ll do something simpler: create a single calendar on my office computer which I subscribe to at home, and subscribe to all the rest of my calendars at my office. I&#8217;ve done that before and it works pretty well. Plaxo is planning to include iCal sync for OS X at some future date, and I&#8217;ll revisit the issue then.

For all my daily files: notebooks, citations, documents I&#8217;m working on, etc. I&#8217;ve decided the best solution is a USB drive. Uploading to Jungle Disk is just too slow on my home DSL connection. I also discovered a great application which allows me to specify folders I wish to keep in sync between my computer and my USB drive. It is called <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/7230" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/7230', 'CronoSync']);" >CronoSync</a> and it is very easy to use. For instance, I can create a single folder full of aliases to files & folders I want to sync and it will include them. I can also mark items I don&#8217;t want to sync with a &#8220;label&#8221; in the finder.

Finally, Password Maker doesn&#8217;t offer two-way sync, but you can manually upload and download to a WebDav or FTP server pretty well.

It has all taken some work to figure out what I needed &#8211; but most of this seems to work pretty well without thinking once you&#8217;ve set it all up.

UPDATE: For the rest of my files I gave up on the Chrono-sync + USB Drive solution since having to sync *twice* was both annoying and prone to trouble. I figured out how to connect to my office computer directly from home over the network, but found Chrono-sync was too slow for that. However, I then discovered Unison which is great. It is a command-line tool, so it isn&#8217;t for everyone (there is a GUI but it doesn&#8217;t much help if you don&#8217;t understand the command-line). Still, Unison is basically rsync on steroids. Here are some links to <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/unison" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/unison', 'how-to guides for Unison']);" >how-to guides for Unison</a>.

UPDATE: A few months later, I&#8217;d like to report that Unison is still working great. I no longer use NetNewsWire, having switched to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/reader/', 'Google Reader']);" >Google Reader</a>, and there seems to be a <a href="http://spanningsync.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spanningsync.com/', 'new option on the horizon']);" >new option on the horizon</a> for iCal. (And regarding IMAP, I&#8217;m glad I stuck with Luxsci, as Fastmail seems to have had some issues this year.) I should also point out that Writely is now <a href="http://docs.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://docs.google.com/', 'Google Docs']);" >Google Docs</a>.
