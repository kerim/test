Nixon and his crew <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101411_pf.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101411_pf.html', 'suspected Felt']);" >suspected Felt</a> (because they mistakenly thought he was Jewish), but dismissed the idea (because they mistakenly thought he would not risk the damage to his reputation):

> White House officials suspected Felt was leaking to The Post as early as October 1972. According to an account written five years ago by Chase Culeman-Beckman, who contended that Bernstein&#8217;s son had told him Felt was Deep Throat, Nixon, Haldeman and Dean were speculating about Felt during one of the sessions tape-recorded in the White House.
> 
> &#8220;Is he Catholic?&#8221; Nixon asked. Told by Haldeman that Felt was Jewish, Nixon replied, &#8220;[Expletive], [the bureau] put a Jew in there?&#8221; To which Haldeman responded, &#8220;Well that could explain it.&#8221;
> 
> Contrary to their belief, Felt is not Jewish.
> 
> On Feb. 28, 1973, Nixon and Dean again tagged Felt as the potential leaker. He was, Dean told Nixon, &#8220;the only person that knows&#8221; such details. But Nixon was skeptical. No one would risk his career to become an informant.

On Tom Tomorrow&#8217;s blog a reader suggested that Felt was Deep Throat <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2005_02_06.html#002035" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com/weblog/mtarchives/week_2005_02_06.html#002035', 'back in February']);" >back in February</a>.<!-- technorati tags start -->
