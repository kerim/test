<span style="font-size: large;">Another problem with Posterous vs. WordPress is that WordPress automatically shows the name of each person when they post. Posterous does not seem to do this for group blogs. The only work-around I could find was to have students "tag" their posts with their name. This can be done by e-mail by includingÂ ((tags: NAME)) in the subject line of the e-mail. This works, but it is prone to errors. Also, not all themes display tags clearly.</span>
