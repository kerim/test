> Even as welfare rolls have dropped, food stamp use has increased over the last few years, fueled by a surprising spike among the working class. While overall food stamp use has gone up by more than one-third since 2002, the number of recipients who are able-bodied or working and not on welfare has nearly doubled, said Seth Diamond, executive deputy commissioner for the city’s Human Resources Administration, at a City Council hearing last week. Those recipients now account for about 40 percent of the city’s 1.1 million food stamp recipients—and roughly three-quarters of the increase since 2002.
