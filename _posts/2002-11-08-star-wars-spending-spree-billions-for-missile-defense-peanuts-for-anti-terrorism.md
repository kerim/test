>   &#8220;With all the concern about dirty bombs, bioterrorism, and suicide bombers smashing airplanes into power plants, the public has pretty much forgotten about the Pentagon&#8217;s ballistic-missile-defense program. (Wasn&#8217;t that some nutty dream of Ronald Reagan&#8217;s?) So, it may come as a shock to learn that President Bush will spend $7.4 billion on R&D for missile defenses next year. That&#8217;s twice the sum that Reagan spent on "star wars" in his final year of office?
