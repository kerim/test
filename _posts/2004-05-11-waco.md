Who is Army Chief of Staff Peter J. Schoomaker? He is one of the &#8220;Rumsfeld underlings&#8221; who gave testimony before congress about Abu Ghraib. David Neiwert <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/archives/2004_05_09_dneiwert_archive.html#108424458408788027" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/archives/2004_05_09_dneiwert_archive.html#108424458408788027', 'gives us the scoop']);" >gives us the scoop</a>:

> Schoomaker&#8217;s name may be familiar. Regular readers will recall it coming up in the context of a discussion of how the misadventure in Iraq <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2004_04_25_dneiwert_archive.html#108305345380975226" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2004_04_25_dneiwert_archive.html#108305345380975226', 'stands as stark testament']);" >stands as stark testament</a> to the Bush administration&#8217;s massive failure to address terrorism seriously or competently. Schoomaker, you see, was one of the military advisers who played a key role in the way the 1993 Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas, turned into a nightmarish disaster that wound up inspiring a fatal wave of domestic terrorism.
