I was sad to hear that Taiwanese filmmaker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yang" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yang', 'Edward Yang']);" >Edward Yang</a> 楊德昌 died so young. I&#8217;d only seen one of his films, *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_yi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_yi', 'Yi yi']);" >Yi yi</a>* (&#8220;A One and a Two&#8221;), but it ranks amongst the best Taiwanese films, moreover Yang was still quite young at 59, having died after a seven year long battle with cancer.

Interestingly, most Taiwanese have never seen *Yi yi*, Yang having refused to distribute it here. I believe he was upset by how little support Taiwanese distributors and audiences gave to their own filmmakers (as opposed to Hollywood), but his disdain can be contrasted with Tsai Ming-liang 蔡明亮 who actively travelled around the country showing his films at universities and giving lectures.

Still, *Yi yi* remains a stingingly accurate portrayal of the hopes, aspirations, and frustrations of the Taiwanese middle class. It also deserves mention for having <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/06/25/2003176516" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/06/25/2003176516', 'NY Bagels']);" >NY Bagels</a> prominently featured in a couple of scenes.

Now I feel compelled to try to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yang#Features" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yang#Features', 'his other films']);" >his other films</a>.
