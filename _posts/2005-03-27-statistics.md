Writing in *Mother Jones*, Bradford Plumer says <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/dailymojo/2005/03/iraq_training_metrics.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.motherjones.com/news/dailymojo/2005/03/iraq_training_metrics.html', 'we need better statistics']);" >we need better statistics</a> to gauge the situation in Iraq:

Official statistics currently claim that 145,000 Iraqi Security Forces are &#8220;trained and equipped.&#8221; Yet the estimated number of troops required has ballooned from roughly 170,000 a year ago to over 270,000 today.

This led me to check on a statistic I hadn&#8217;t looked at in a while: the number of <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iraqbodycount.net/', 'civilians killed as a result of military intervention']);" >civilians killed as a result of military intervention</a> in Iraq. They now estimate **between 17,200 and 19,600 civilian causalities** in Iraq. (Note: Iraqbodycount.net bases their statistics only on accounts published in more than one source, so they tend to be a the low end of the spectrum.)
