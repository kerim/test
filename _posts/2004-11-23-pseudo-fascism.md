No time to write much these days, but please take the time to read David Neiwert&#8217;s 7 part article on &#8220;<a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2004/11/holiday-break.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2004/11/holiday-break.html', 'The Rise of Pseudo Fascism']);" >The Rise of Pseudo Fascism</a>.&#8221;

Some announcements:

I&#8217;m going to try to keep posting over the next two months, but it will be difficult. I have a lot to do over the next few weeks, and then I am going to India for a month. I hope to blog about the trip to India, but I don&#8217;t know how easy that will be to do (or how motivated I will be to do it until I return).

I should also note that I&#8217;ve made some updates to the site recently, adding <a href="http://forums.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forums.oxus.net/', 'forums']);" >forums</a>, updating my <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/', 'homepage']);" >homepage</a>, and adding another line of defense in my battle against <a href="http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/spam/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/spam/', 'comment SPAM']);" >comment SPAM</a>. Let me know if you see any problems.
