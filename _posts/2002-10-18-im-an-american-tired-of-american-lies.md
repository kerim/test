Actor Woody Harrelson gets political in London!  



>   &#8220;Woodman and I agree about a lot of things, but one thing we can never agree about is Iraq. He thinks the only language Saddam understands is brute force. I don&#8217;t believe we should be bombing cities in our quest for one man. We&#8217;ve killed a million Iraqis since the start of the Gulf war &#8211; mostly by blocking humanitarian aid. Let&#8217;s stop now. Thankfully, most of the Brits I talk to about the war are closer to me than to Woodman. Only your prime minister doesn&#8217;t seem to have noticed.&#8221;
