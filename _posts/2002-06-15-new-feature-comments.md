I&#8217;ve finally enabled a new feature on the web site, which will enable registered users to post comments on any item in the web log. You can comment on each other&#8217;s comments as well. To avoid too much e-mail, I have set it so that comments **will not** be forwarded to the e-mail list. I can change this if people think it would be OK.

To regester, simply click on the below link. Your e-mail address will be encrypted on the site, so there should be no danger of SPAM from registering. There is, however, a special feature which will allow members to send e-mail to other members via a form. Once you register, you will be registered for all my blogs.
