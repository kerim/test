> I first thought of trying this out next fall, but then, about three weeks ago, I tossed out the idea in my Anth 133a class (Tradition and Contemporary Experience in Sub-Saharan Africa) that we might try to do a &#8216;podcast&#8221;-suitable audio guide for a fascinating exhibition that unexpectedly came to Brandeis &#8211; &#8220;Body Maps&#8221;, on painted self-representations by HIV-positive South African women. We&#8217;d just read the second volume of Jean and John Comaroff&#8217;s &#8220;Of Revolution and Revelation&#8221;, and were working our way through Jennifer Cole&#8217;s&#8221; Forget Colonialism,&#8221; and when we did a session down at the exhibition, I was dazzled by the students&#8217; thoughtful applications of these works to the paintings. It seemed pretty clear to me that the students had the ability to develop fascinating audio guides for visitors.
