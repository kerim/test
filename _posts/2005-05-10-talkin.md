> *Talkin&#8217; About Talk* is a collection of fascinating insights into language: a series of 52 little essays&#8211;conversational in tone, light and anecdotal in style&#8211;that encourage language study and invite listeners to look further into the subject of each essay. The series, part of the *2005: The Year of Languages* celebration, was co-sponsored by the College of Charleston (SC) and the National Museum of Language. The material was written by a wide-ranging group of experts, including some of the most well-known linguists in America. 

The first twenty programs are online and available <a href="http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3963" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3963', 'here']);" >here</a>. They are about 5 min each. I haven&#8217;t listened to them all, but what I&#8217;ve heard so far makes for a good introduction to contemporary issues in linguistics, sociolinguistics, and linguistic anthropology. They are basically just one person talking (the same person no matter who wrote the segment), which gives them a bit of monotonous tone &#8211; especially if you listen to more than a couple in a row. It would have been nice if they had been more like NPR news segments with interviews and real-world sounds mixed in.<!-- technorati tags start -->
