&#8220;Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! &#8220;<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php', 'Michael Moore']);" >Michael Moore</a>

The following poem was written by Wilfred Owen (1893-1918) and published in 1921. It describes a Mustard Gas attack during World War I.

>     Bent double, like of old beggars under sacks,<br /> Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br /> Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br /> And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br /> Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br /> But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind:<br /> Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br /> Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.

>     Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!&#8212; An ecstasy of fumbling,<br /> Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br /> But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,<br /> And flound&#8217;ring like a man in fire or lime &#8230;<br /> Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br /> As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
>

>   
>     In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br /> He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br /> If in sonic smothering dreams you too could pace<br /> Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br /> And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br /> His hanging face, like a devil&#8217;s sick of sin;<br /> If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br /> Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br /> Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br /> Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,&#8212;<br /> My friend, you would not talk with such high zest<br /> To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br /> The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est<br /> Pro patria mori. </blockquote>
