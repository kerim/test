A known terrorist enters the United States and the department of Homeland Security only arrests him after a Miami-based *NY Times* reporter points it out to them. They charge him with the minor crime of &#8220;illegal entry&#8221; and then <a href="http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/wp_20061112new.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/wp_20061112new.html', '&#8220;lost&#8221; all the evidence']);" >&#8220;lost&#8221; all the evidence</a> relating to his case &#8230; Did I mention that this terrorist was trained by the CIA and that the <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/world/americas/15719066.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/world/americas/15719066.htm', 'CIA had been warned']);" >CIA had been warned</a> in advance of his plans to blow up a Cubana Airlines plane? Or that George Bush Senior was head of the CIA at the time?

Well, all that is just the beginning, because now they are also trying to get copies of the remaining evidence from the <a href="http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/wp_20061112new.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/wp_20061112new.html', 'NY Times reporter']);" ><em>NY Times</em> reporter</a> who broke the story in the first place. I&#8217;m sure they just want to put that evidence in a safe place &#8230;
