Body and Soul really outdoes herself with one of the most articulate and coherent discussions of both Iraqi &#8220;resistance&#8221; and US efforts at &#8220;reconstruction.&#8221; It would do injustice to the post for me to summarize it or provide excerpts &#8211; so <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/resistance.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/resistance.html', 'just go read it']);" >just go read it</a>!
