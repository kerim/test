From Teller&#8217;s <a href="http://nytimes.com/2004/08/01/books/review/01TELLERL.html?pagewanted=print&#038;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nytimes.com/2004/08/01/books/review/01TELLERL.html?pagewanted=print&position=', 'review']);" >review</a> of Penn&#8217;s new book:

> Finally, in the interest of full disclosure: six times a week onstage in Las Vegas, Penn fires a .357 Magnum revolver at my face. It&#8217;s a trick. I end up alive and healthy with the bullet neatly caught between my teeth. I survive, in large part, because Penn always does his part of the trick correctly. I assure you, however, this would never skew my view of Penn&#8217;s literary achievement.
