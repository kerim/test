I have, on occasion, been criticized for using the construction &#8220;more perfect,&#8221; being told that it is incorrect and illogical. So I was happy to see <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000995.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000995.html', 'Bill Poser&#8217;s post']);" >Bill Poser&#8217;s post</a> on the topic.

He defends the phrase on both logical&#8230;

> &#8230; it seems likely that when we say that something is *perfect* we mean that its degree of perfection falls within a distance *d* of absolute perfection, where the value of *d* is contextually determined. This allows us on the one hand to cut *d* down to 0 by specifying that something is *absolutely perfect* and on the other hand to talk about things approaching more and less closely to perfection. 

and historical grounds:

> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a **more perfect Union**&#8230;

However, I think he might need to modify his logical argument to take into account the phrase &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;ie=ISO-8859-1&#038;c2coff=1&#038;q=%22beyond+perfect%22&#038;btnG=Search" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&c2coff=1&q=%22beyond+perfect%22&btnG=Search', 'beyond perfect']);" >beyond perfect</a>&#8220;!
