From Boingboing.net, three stories on &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/justice_dept_censors.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/justice_dept_censors.html', '1']);" >1</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/rnc_protests_bikes_a.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/rnc_protests_bikes_a.html', '2']);" >2</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/rnc_protests_first_a.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/29/rnc_protests_first_a.html', '3']);" >3</a>):

First, a story from the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=16275&#038;c=262" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=16275&c=262', 'ACLU']);" >ACLU</a>, whose court filing was censored by the Justice Department. Here is the passage they redacted:

> The danger to political dissent is acute where the Government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect &#8216;domestic security.&#8217; Given the difficulty of defining the domestic security interest, the danger of abuse in acting to protect that interest becomes apparent.

You can see both versions <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/feds/justice_redaction.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thememoryhole.org/feds/justice_redaction.htm', 'here']);" >here</a>.

Secondly, &#8220;<a href="http://bikesagainstbush.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bikesagainstbush.com/', 'Bikesagainstbush']);" >Bikesagainstbush</a> creator Joshua Kinberg was <a href="http://nyc.indymedia.org/feature/display/106015/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nyc.indymedia.org/feature/display/106015/index.php', 'arrested']);" >arrested</a> while taping an interview with MSNBC&#8217;s Ron Reagan in Manhattan Saturday afternoon.&#8221;

> When Kinberg showed the police sergeant how the bicycle used a non-permanent spray chalk, the sergeant seemed to agree that it wasn&#8217;t defacement, at which point Kinberg asked, &#8220;am I free to go?&#8221; After conferring about it, officers decided to call superiors, then came back moments later to place Kinberg under arrest and confiscate the bicycle.
> 
> Kinberg cooperated fully with the officers as he was being handcuffed, only asking, &#8220;can I ask what I&#8217;m being arrested for?&#8221; to which no one provided an answer. As of 11:00 PM Saturday evening, he was still in custody without being charged with anything.
> 
> Video of the incident is available as a <a href="http://dv.open4all.info/bblog/torrent_files/20040828_kinberg.mov.torrent" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dv.open4all.info/bblog/torrent_files/20040828_kinberg.mov.torrent', 'torrent']);" >torrent</a> at DV Guide.

Finally, on a more positive front, <a href="http://revbilly.com/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://revbilly.com/index.php', 'Reverend Billy']);" >Reverend Billy</a> is organizing

> demonstrations where smart mobs gathered in public places to recite the First Amendment. On Saturday before the largest demonstration in the city, he <a href="http://www.gomaya.com/glyph/archives/000969.html#000969" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gomaya.com/glyph/archives/000969.html#000969', 'led the faithful']);" >led the faithful</a> in six rousing choruses of that basic right.

I&#8217;ve heard Rev. Billy preach (at an Anti-CVS protest in Woodstock, NY), and he is truly inspirational. (Funny too!)
