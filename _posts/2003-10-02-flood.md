>   Adonis is not as popular as Mahmoud Darwish in the Arab world, but he&#8217;s still widely read and respected. Here&#8217;s my problem. While I think that Adonis is deserving, I&#8217;m irked about reports that the choice is motivated by desires to appease Arab audiences after the Iraq war. Adonis should win on the strength of his work, not because the time is right.


I really don&#8217;t know anything about Arab poetry, but I do know that, as with Russian poetry, it is taken much more seriously than we take poetry here in the U.S. One professor told me that if you want to understand politics in the Middle East, you must read the poetry. So I thought that even if Adonis doesn&#8217;t win, here is a chance to get better acquainted with at least one, <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/darwish_m.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://i-cias.com/e.o/darwish_m.htm', 'or two']);" >or two</a>, Arab poets.
