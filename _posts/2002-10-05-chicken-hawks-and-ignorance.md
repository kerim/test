>   &#8220;Ignorance seems to be a guiding principle among the administration&#8217;s hawks. Dick Cheney supported South African apartheid and voted against a congressional resolution to free Nelson Mandela from prison. According to Frances Fitzgerald in The New York Review of Books, Cheney didn&#8217;t trust Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and advised President Reagan to keep up Cold War pressure rather than encourage Gorbachev&#8217;s reforms.

He and others in the Bush administration, including Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, are on record as opposing a Palestinian state. Is this how the Bush administration expects to get Islamic support for its "get Saddam" policy?
