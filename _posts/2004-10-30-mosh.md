But I&#8217;m still a little uneasy about all those black hoodies.

Yeah, me too. I didn&#8217;t care much for the song (not much more than a beat), but the video is very slickly produced. Voter turnout is the #1 issue in this year&#8217;s election, and the most important factor in securing a Kerry win. Fortunately, things are looking up. <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000881.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000881.php', 'Ruy Teixeira']);" >Ruy Teixeira</a> quotes Curtis Gans, who is optimistic:

> There is reason to believe that this year&#8217;s increased registration, coupled with heightened voter interest and intense feelings generated by the 2004 election campaign, will produce substantially higher turnout this year.

Also see why <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000887.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000887.php', 'Ruy']);" >Ruy</a> likes <a href="http://www.nowchannel.com/latest/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nowchannel.com/latest/', 'NowChannel.com']);" >NowChannel.com</a> over <a href="http://electoral-vote.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://electoral-vote.com/', 'Electoral-Vote.com']);" >Electoral-Vote.com</a> for tracking the latest polls. This is a bit over my head, but I have nothing but respect for Ruy Teixeira, so I&#8217;ll take his word (even if NowChannel doesn&#8217;t have a pretty map).
