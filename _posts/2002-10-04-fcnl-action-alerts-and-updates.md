>     Despite a number of changes from the original White House draft resolution, the compromise joint congressional resolution would still provide the President with a blank check to take preemptive, unilateral military action against Iraq, when and how he deemed necessary. The compromise text does express support for diplomatic efforts through the UN Security Council, but it is not binding in this regard. Unlike the original White House resolution which extended authorization for military action to the region, the compromise text authorizes U.S. military action only against Iraq. The compromise text requires the President to certify to Congress that diplomatic efforts had failed prior to or within 48 hours of launching war against Iraq and to report on progress every 60 days. However, the President would have full discretion to declare the failure of diplomacy at any time he chose and to wage war without further congressional approval. The compromise resolution does not condition a U.S. war against Iraq on approval from the UN Security Council or other multilateral support.
