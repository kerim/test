Please join me in signing an online petition asking President Bush to let the weapons inspections work, rather than rushing to war. If we don&#8217;t act now, we could be at war by the end of the month.

Inspections in Iraq have started. Most of us breathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s become clear that the ultra-hawks in the Bush administration &#8212; Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle &#8212; will not take yes for an answer. While the rest of the world thinks Iraq has backed down, these men are pursuing a massive public relations blitz for war.

With the possibility of a peaceful resolution to this crisis at hand, we cannot allow a few men to push the world to war. Send a message to President Bush and Congress to let the inspections work at:

MoveOn.org will compile our messages and present them to the administration, including Secretary of State Powell, to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and to members of Congress.

The good news is that the ultra-hawks face some serious opposition. Secretary of State Colin Powell and other members of the Bush Administration are willing to give diplomacy a chance, and the State Department&#8217;s interpretation of the U.N. resolution is a lot more reasonable than the White House&#8217;s interpretation.

President Bush has agreed that war should be the very last resort. Let&#8217;s hold him and his Administration to those words:

Please join me and sign on today. We must support policy makers who will oppose these few extremists in the Bush White House who have been looking for an excuse for war from the very beginning.
