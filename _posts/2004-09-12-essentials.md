Every once in a while a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:meme" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=define:meme', 'meme']);" >meme</a> starts circulating from one blog to another. Either everyone is supposed to list sentences from random books on their shelf, take a picture of their workspace, check off which books they&#8217;ve read from some random list, etc. I have so far successfully avoided these. However, this one is actually something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do anyway, so I&#8217;m happy to oblige.

<a href="http://www.jluster.org/indispensable" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jluster.org/indispensable', 'Jonas']);" >Jonas</a>, <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/09/my_favorite_applications.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/09/09/my_favorite_applications.html', 'Joi']);" >Joi</a>, and <a href="http://blog.kung-foo.tv/archives/001121.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.kung-foo.tv/archives/001121.php', 'Adriaan']);" >Adriaan</a> have all listed some of their favorite applications for Mac OS X. So here is my list of <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/essentials" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/essentials', '42 essential programs for Mac OS X']);" >42 essential programs for Mac OS X</a>. Some of them may not be essential to you &#8211; at least three are Chinese related, and a few more are geek tools that not everyone will use, but they are all great apps and you might not have heard of some of them, so <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/essentials" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/essentials', 'check it out']);" >check it out</a>. The list will probably continue to grow, so you might want to bookmark it (or subscribe to the RSS feed for that tag).
