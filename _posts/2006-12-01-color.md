The funny thing is that this is how I usually look for books &#8211; by color. Unfortunately I&#8217;m often wrong about the colors I&#8217;m looking for &#8230; or only have a vague sense influenced by one of various design elements. What if there is a blue picture on the cover, but the spine is red? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d find the book. Another problem I&#8217;ve noticed is that over time sunlight yellows books nearer the window faster than those further away, so the color scheme will shift with the years. My mother has perfect color memory, so when she moves to her new house next year she could give this a try!
