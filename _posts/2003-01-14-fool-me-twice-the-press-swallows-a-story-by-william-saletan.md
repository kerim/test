This is a brilliant piece by Saletan, in which he takes the administration&#8217;s garbage about Iraq&#8217;s supposed Weapons of Mass Destruction, and shows how absurd it all is by making it seem as if it is the Clonaid story!


>   &#8220;Should reporters be embarrassed that they gave the story so much play? No. They should be embarrassed because the story isn&#8217;t about Clonaid. It&#8217;s about Iraq. The quotes above are real, but they don&#8217;t come from Boisselier. They come from White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of State Colin Powell.&#8221;
