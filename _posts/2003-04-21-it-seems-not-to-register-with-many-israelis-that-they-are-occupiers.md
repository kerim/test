>   It seems not to register with many Israelis that they are occupiers and as such have inescapable responsibilities towards those in their custody and an obligation to end the occupation as speedily as possible. It is an obligation reinforced by Israel&#8217;s decision after the 1967 war not to grant citizenship and equal rights in the Jewish state to the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza, even in return for Israel&#8217;s permanent retention of the occupied territories. The inescapable corollary of this decision is that Israel must grant Palestinians the right to their own state. The alternative is permanent disenfranchisement and subjugation of the Palestinians.

Mr Sharon&#8217;s notion of a Palestinian &#8220;state&#8221; in less than 50 per cent of the West Bank and in parts of Gaza would create South African style bantustans entirely under Israel&#8217;s control.
