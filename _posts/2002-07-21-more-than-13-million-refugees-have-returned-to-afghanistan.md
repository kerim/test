I generally don&#8217;t post from the WSJ, because it requires a subscription, but this quote pretty much says it all&#8230;


>   &#8220;More than 1.3 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan &#8212; more than three times the number expected &#8212; forcing the United Nations to cut aid programs because of the shortage of funds, a U.N. official said Sunday. 
>   
>   
>     Maki Shinohara, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, said the dramatic flow of returning refugees, one of the largest in the history, has "sapped UNHCR&#8217;s $271 million budget for Afghanistan."
>   
>   
>   
>     Ms. Shinohara said the agency lacks about $65 million to get through the end of the year and that cash contributions were urgently needed.&#8221;
