I wasn&#8217;t happy with <a href="http://mccainfacts.jottit.com/more_information" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mccainfacts.jottit.com/more_information', 'similar sites']);" >similar sites</a> I found on the web, so I created <a href="http://mccainfacts.jottit.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mccainfacts.jottit.com/', 'a wiki']);" >a wiki</a> to get the word out about some of the more disagreeable positions taken by the McCain campaign. The idea being that all the claims on the wiki are verifiable statements about actual **policy positions** taken by John McCain. They are not about his record or his personal life.
