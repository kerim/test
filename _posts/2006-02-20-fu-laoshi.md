Titles are very important in Taiwanese society. It is incredibly impolite to call someone by their given name, unless you are close friends or colleagues. Even then a nickname might be more common among friends and surname-plus-title among colleagues. Another option is to say the full name: surname + given name.

My Chinese name is Fu Ke-en (傅可恩). My efforts to get people to call me Ke-en generally fail. Generally, I end up getting called either &#8220;Mr. Fu&#8221; (傅先生）or &#8220;teacher Fu&#8221; (傅老師). The best I can do now that I am a college professor is to insist on the less formal &#8220;teacher&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;professor&#8221; (教授). So, that is how I normally introduce myself: &#8220;teacher fu.&#8221;

Today, when a colleague introduced me to the owner of her favorite bubble tea stand, the owner asked me how she should address me. I replied, as usual, &#8220;teacher Fu&#8221; (傅老師). To which she replied: &#8220;Oh, Professor Fu. Too bad, you&#8217;ll never become a full professor!&#8221; The joke being that &#8220;Professor Fu&#8221; sounds exactly like the term for &#8220;associate professor&#8221; (副教授). That&#8217;s what you get for ordering bubble tea near a university!

*Postscript*: An interesting exception to the &#8220;no given name&#8221; rule is among those with greater English proficiency. Such people will use adopted English names even among Chinese-speaking friends.
