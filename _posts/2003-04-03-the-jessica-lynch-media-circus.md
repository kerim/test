I&#8217;m very happy that Jessica Lynch is safe. I&#8217;m also impressed at the rescue operation which succeeded where others had <a href="http://www.borderlandnews.com/war/stories/20030331-94562.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.borderlandnews.com/war/stories/20030331-94562.shtml', 'failed']);" >failed</a> (resulting in nine marine deaths). But I think that William Saletan in Slate asks some good hard questions about the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2080889/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2080889/', 'media circus']);" >media circus</a> that surrounded her rescue.


>   I don&#8217;t mean to be callous or unpatriotic, but why are we celebrating so loudly? Before this war began, Jessica Lynch was safe and unharmed. Now she&#8217;s safe and harmed.

We&#8217;ve said this war isn&#8217;t an invasion. We&#8217;ve said it isn&#8217;t for us but for Iraq. And yet, while the average Iraqi&#8217;s liberation gets no Pentagon fanfare and no air time, the liberation of Jessica Lynch is a 24-hour mediathon. We&#8217;re celebrating her rescue for the worst of all reasons: because she&#8217;s American.

Personally, I think it is much more than this. I think it goes to long-standing fears (and fantasies) about what happens to white women at the hands of Arabs. Here are some old paitings from the &#8220;orientalist school&#8221; which show just what I mean:
