> Here, for instance, is a passage, you&#8217;ll rarely see in the American press. In a piece for the Independent, the British journalist Patrick Cockburn writes, &#8220;The rebels are nationalist and religious. The US always appears to underestimate the strength of Iraqi nationalism.&#8221; As a term, nationalism has long been oddly wielded in the United States. Americans are almost never described (here) as nationalistic. We are &#8220;patriotic,&#8221; and patriotism, it turns out, is an almost purely American trait. On the other hand, over recent decades, other peoples, particularly in the non-western world were seldom patriotic, they were nationalistic; and those among them who fought for sovereignty and power never patriots, but at best nationalists. Nationalism in our American world has long had a distinctly pejorative quality. It brings to mind not the flag, mom, and apple pie (nor the flag, mom, and shish kebob), but a force over the edge, slightly unhinged, fanatical, dangerous; something, at best, to be managed. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s been here for a long time.

Except, as Tom explains, lately the Iraqis aren&#8217;t even &#8220;nationalists&#8221;, but &#8220;only &#8216;former Baathists,&#8217; &#8216;bitter-enders,&#8217; &#8216;foreign fighters.&#8217; &#8230; religious fanatics, al-Qaeda supporters, terrorists&#8221; etc. But not &#8220;nationalists&#8221;, and definitely not &#8220;patriots.&#8221;
