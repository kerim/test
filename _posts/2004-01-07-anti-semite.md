It seems conservative commentators are labeling anyone who criticizes the right as an anti-Semite:


>   We&#8217;ve now gone from arguments where anti-Semitism is perceived at the margins of critiques of neoconservative intellectuals to the current practice in which it is treated as a given that &#8216;neoconservative&#8217; is simply a code word for Jew and criticisms of the same are one shade or another of anti-Semitism.


He is correct to point out that this should be &#8220;roundly and vociferously criticized.&#8221; But it is a strategy that has worked so well for right wing supporters of Israel that I suppose the neoconservatives felt it was worth a try. It is unfortunate because the problem of anti-Semitism is both wide spread and real, and these misuses make the term ineffective where it is really needed.
