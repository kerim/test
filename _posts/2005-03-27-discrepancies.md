He then goes on to highlight some of the most shocking discrepancies:

>   * Sixty-nine percent of whites are insured through their employers, compared with only 52 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Hispanics.
>   * African Americans and Hispanic Americans are far more likely to rely on hospitals or clinics for their usual source of care than are white Americans.
>   * The higher the percentage of blacks in a community, the more likely the hospital is to close. Of the more than 200 hospitals in black communities in the 1930s, only 12 were still operating in 1991.
>   * Among preschool children hospitalized for asthma, only 7 percent of black and 2 percent of Hispanic children, compared with 21 percent of white children, are prescribed routine medications to prevent future asthma-related hospitalizations.
>   * Whites are two to three times more likely to receive a kidney transplant than non-whites, and three times more likely to undergo bypass surgery.
