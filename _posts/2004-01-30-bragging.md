Now Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, has provided a thoughtful essay on the topic, which is well worth reading. <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/amnesty_and_hrw.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/amnesty_and_hrw.html', 'Jeanne']);" >Jeanne</a> at Body and Soul, gets right to the point:

> This was not a war in support of human rights. That may be the most damaging lie Bush has told, because there&#8217;s an enormous danger that it could become a model for how we deal with human rights issues.
