In <a href="http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=17998" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=17998', 'this AlterNet article']);" >this AlterNet article</a>, Kevin Griffis travels around the South, trying to figure out why poor whites vote for Bush, even though it is clearly against their own interests to do so. I particularly liked this quote:

> Like much of the rural South, each town I visited was relatively poor, overwhelmingly white and voted for President Bush in 2000. At each stop, I looked for working poor and middle-income people, asked them how they voted and why. The answers were depressingly facile, filled with the perfectly parroted lingo of the right-wing echo chamber, and yet, once I dug, often so thin, disconnected and confused that I wondered whether a strong wind (or populist candidate with the right message) might reorder the political landscape.
