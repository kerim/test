Let me start with a personal revelation: I have toenail fungus. It is a very common problem, one that can easily be cured with a pill. The problem? <a href="http://www.consumerdruginfo.com/lamfdahealthadvis.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.consumerdruginfo.com/lamfdahealthadvis.html', 'People have died of liver complications after taking the pill']);" >People have died of liver complications after taking the pill</a>. Great &#8211; the FDA issued a *warning* &#8211; but why is the drug *still on the market* after **13 people died** (as of March, 2001)? My foot doctor didn&#8217;t even tell me about these deaths. I only became suspicious because he had me get a blood test to check my liver. He suggested it was just a &#8220;precaution&#8221; and that complications could only occur if I had a &#8220;damaged&#8221; liver. Although it is less effective (and more expensive in the long-run), one can take a topical treatment, which is what I chose to do. I&#8217;m glad I did, especially after seeing last-night&#8217;s Frontline about the<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/', ' all-too-cozy relationship between the FDA and the industry they are supposed to be regulating']);" > all-too-cozy relationship between the FDA and the industry they are supposed to be regulating</a>. What is the problem?


>   The pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s influence gets exerted in a number of ways. One, starting 10 years ago [with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)], the influence was exerted by their directly funding, paying cash right up front, for FDA review. So in many ways, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/hazard/independent.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/hazard/independent.html', 'the FDA started looking upon the industry as their client, instead of the public']);" >the FDA started looking upon the industry as their client, instead of the public</a> and the public health, which should be the client.


How does this effect the quality of FDA reports?


>   I was told very explicitly, &#8220;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/interviews/elashoff.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/interviews/elashoff.html', 'Don&#8217;t write in your review that you&#8217;re recommending against approval']);" >Don&#8217;t write in your review that you&#8217;re recommending against approval</a>. Write that the data is unclear, you could go either way.&#8221; So it was quite explicit. &#8230; It was pretty typical that, at the start of a review, the division director would say, &#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t really see any issues with this drug. Some small things may come up in the course of your reviews. You have to do a careful review, but I don&#8217;t see any roadblocks on the way to approval.&#8221; That would set an overall tone for the review, where potential problems were really de-emphasized in the meetings to discuss the data.

You knew that if you found a problem and wanted to pursue it, it would take a lot of extra effort, a lot of extra meetings, a lot of extra justification for why something wouldn&#8217;t be approved. Whereas, if you felt the drug was safe and effective, very rarely would someone challenge you on that.

As a result of this very unprofessional climate, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of drugs approved by the FDA &#8211; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/etc/dozen.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/prescription/etc/dozen.html', 'and the number of drugs later removed from the market because of safety concerns']);" >and the number of drugs later removed from the market because of safety concerns</a>. (i.e. People die or get sick from side effects of the drugs which have been approved.)

So &#8211; before you take any prescription medication, first do some research on your own!
