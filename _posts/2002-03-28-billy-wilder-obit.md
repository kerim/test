Billy Wilder, the caustic writer and director who won six Academy Awards and international acclaim as one of the world&#8217;s great filmmakers and then spent the last 21 years of his vivid life imploring Hollywood to let him make another movie, died on Wednesday night at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 95.
