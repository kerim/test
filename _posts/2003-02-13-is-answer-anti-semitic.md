>   On Monday, David Corn reported in The Nation that the A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) crowd is planning to block Rabbi Michael Lerner from speaking at the Feb. 16 antiwar rally in San Francisco (which A.N.S.W.E.R. is co-sponsoring). Lerner, the founder of Tikkun magazine, has long been among the most persistently progressive voices in the Jewish community, and he has staked out a strident antiwar position on Iraq. He is also perhaps the leading American Jewish agitator both for Palestinian rights and against the hawkish government of Ariel Sharon. Lerner, however, also supports the right of Israel to exist. And he therefore qualifies as a Zionist, though a dovish one.
