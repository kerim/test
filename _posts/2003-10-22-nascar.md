Inequality is increasing, but those getting the short end of the stick &#8211; blue collar workers &#8211; are largely in favor of Bush. How can that be?

First the inequality part, from an excellent post over at the <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/000805.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://billmon.org/archives/000805.html', 'Whiskey Bar']);" >Whiskey Bar</a> (via <a href="http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_10_19_marston_archive.html#106676544760897437" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_10_19_marston_archive.html#106676544760897437', 'Marstonalia']);" >Marstonalia</a>):


>   The latest available data &#8212; for 2000 and 2001 &#8212; shows the trend towards greater inequality has accelerated again (not surprising, given the policies of a GOP-controlled government.) Job growth has stalled, leaving the unemployment rate well above the &#8220;natural&#8221; non-deflationary rate. This is putting downward pressure on cash wages. Meanwhile, soaring health care costs are gobbling up much of the gains from rising labor productivity &#8212; further discouraging employers from hiring.


Then the question of why those at the bottom still support Bush. Well, not the bottom exactly, but blue-collar workers &#8211; especially men. The author refers to hem as &#8220;Nascar Dads&#8221; in a catchy phrase that makes a nice contrast with &#8220;Soccer Moms:


>   Until Nixon, Republicans had for a century written off the blue-collar voter. But <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/1003-12.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.commondreams.org/views03/1003-12.htm', 'turning Marx on his head, Nixon appealed not to a desire for real economic change but to the distress caused by the absence of it']);" >turning Marx on his head, Nixon appealed not to a desire for real economic change but to the distress caused by the absence of it</a>. And it worked as it&#8217;s doing again now. In the l972 contest between Nixon and McGovern, 57% of the manual worker vote and 54% of the union vote went to Nixon. (This meant 22 and 25-point gains for Nixon over his l968 presidential run.) After Nixon, other Republican presidents &#8212; Ford, Reagan, and Bush Sr. &#8212; followed in the same footsteps, although not always so cleverly.

>     Now George Bush Jr. is pursuing a sequel strategy by again appealing to the emotions of male blue-collar voters. Only he&#8217;s added a new element to the mix. Instead of appealing, as Nixon did, to anger at economic decline, Bush is appealing to fear of economic displacement, and offering the Nascar Dad a set of villains to blame, and a hero to thank &#8212; George W. Bush.
