I forget where I read that looking at how often the word &#8220;recession&#8221; appears in the newspaper is as good a method as any of determining whether we are actually in a recession or not, it might have been the <a href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/', 'Left Business Observer']);" >Left Business Observer</a>, but I after seeing the word pop up a few times recently, I thought I&#8217;d see <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=recession&#038;ctab=0&#038;geo=US&#038;geor=all&#038;date=all&#038;sort=0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/trends?q=recession&ctab=0&geo=US&geor=all&date=all&sort=0', 'what Google Trends showed']);" >what Google Trends showed</a>. The result doesn&#8217;t look good. 

Note that it is only the occurrence of the word that matters, the context is unimportant &#8211; as in the Feb 28th 2007 news story titled &#8220;Economists: Recession unlikely&#8221; which sparked off a flurry of searches on Google. More recent reports are far less optimistic.
