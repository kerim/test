If you have

used Yahoo to purchase anything, for their e-mail forwarding service, or any

other service where you might have given them your address, phone number,

and e-mail address, then act soon or you will get spammed at all three

addresses starting in JUNE!!!

If you have a username and password for anything at Yahoo.com, then you

should go to <a href="http://my.yahoo.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://my.yahoo.com', 'http://my.yahoo.com']);" >http://my.yahoo.com</a> and click on &#8220;account info&#8221; at the top of

the page (after logging in). You will see an item called &#8220;Edit my marketing

preferences&#8221;. Yahoo has just re-set these so that everyone will start

getting bombarded with SPAM in JUNE &#8211; including your home address if they

have that, and even via the telephone!!! However, you have until June to go

to their web page and turn these options OFF.

I feel, as a matter of principle, that such settings should always be

set to &#8220;no&#8221; unless people voluntarily &#8220;opt-in&#8221; and turn the features on. If

you feel the same way, and have a Yahoo account, please write to Yahoo to

express your feelings. You can reach Yahoo at:

<a href="mailto:yhoocc@yahoo-inc.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','mailto','yhoocc@yahoo-inc.com']);" >yhoocc@yahoo-inc.com</a>
