At Osaka Technical High School he took up the drums because, he says, &#8220;all you have to do is hit them.&#8221; Before long he was making more money than anyone else in the school by thumping away in a Hawaiian band that played the old dance-halls left behind by American G.I.s.

He invented karaoke for the president of a small steel company who was a fan of Inoue&#8217;s music and wanted to sing along while on an overnight trip:

> the drummer&#8211;unable to leave his job &#8212; obliged by providing him with a tape of his accompaniment. The boss delivered an emotional rendition of Frank Nagai&#8217;s Leaving Haneda Airport on a 7:50 Flight, Inoue collected his money in absentia and karaoke (a term long used in the industry for house musicians&#8211;it literally means &#8220;empty orchestra&#8221;) was born.

Inoue later created a business making machines which would play a number of songs and providing them to local nightclubs. Unfortunately, he never secured the intellectual property rights to the idea, and so didn&#8217;t make any money from the global fad he started. His company even went broke&#8230;

Daisuke Inoue received the 2004 <a href="http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2004" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2004', 'Ig Nobel Peace Prize']);" >Ig Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his invention.
