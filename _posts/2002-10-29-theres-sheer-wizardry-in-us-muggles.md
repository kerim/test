Chris Mooney seems to miss the overt similarities to British Colinial policy, but he does a good job of highlighting the contradictions in how Muggles are treated in Harry Potter.


>   &#8220;Muggles aren&#8217;t evil, but the ideal wizarding approach to them seems to be a kind of enlightened paternalism, most genially embodied in the character of Arthur Weasley, father of Harry&#8217;s best friend and a bureaucrat who often sounds a lot like an animal rights activist when referring to his Muggle protectorate. For Weasley, Muggles are fascinating to study, but for the rest of wizarding society they are sufficiently inferior that they need to be ruled by a vast secret government, the Ministry of Magic, which passes occasional "Muggle Protection Acts."&#8221;
