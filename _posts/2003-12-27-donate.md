I personally believe the most important way the Democrats can defeat Bush is to get more people to the polls. Obviously, part of this requires delivering a message that will motivate people to vote, but a lot is simply grassroots mobilization &#8211; something the Republicans, especially the far right, has been very good at.

There are a number of organizations mobilized to do this, and as a result of <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/11/meyerson-h.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/11/meyerson-h.html', 'recent changes in campaign finance laws']);" >recent changes in campaign finance laws</a>, these organizations have become even more important:

<a href="http://www.americacomingtogether.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.americacomingtogether.com/', 'America Coming Together']);" >America Coming Together</a> (General voter outreach to combat Bush.)

<a href="http://www.americasfamilies.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.americasfamilies.org/', 'Partnership for America&#8217;s Families']);" >Partnership for America&#8217;s Families</a> (Backed by organized labor. Has been effective at targeting crucial minority votes in recent local elections.)

<a href="http://www.svrep.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.svrep.org/', 'SouthWest Voter Representation Project']);" >SouthWest Voter Representation Project</a> (Targets Latinos, does not appear to be a partisan organization.)

<a href="http://www.emilyslist.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.emilyslist.org/', 'Emily&#8217;s List']);" >Emily&#8217;s List</a> (A Pro-Democrat, Pro-Choice program to mobilize women voters.)

The best thing you can do is to give these organizations your time, but if you can&#8217;t do that, give them your money!!!

*UPDATE*: A good article about these groups (and more) from <a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/print.php?id=486_0_1_0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.inthesetimes.com/print.php?id=486_0_1_0', 'In These Times']);" >In These Times</a>:

> About a dozen groups&#8212;backed by the likes of Emily&#8217;s List, the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club and MoveOn.org&#8212;are quietly building an infrastructure to undertake the most extensive door-to-door grassroots voter contact operation in U.S. history. Its potential to turn the election already is well understood on both sides: Longtime activists say they haven&#8217;t felt this energized in decades&#8212;and Republicans are using congressional hearings to shut down the operation or steal directly from its playbook.
