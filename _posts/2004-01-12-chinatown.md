I had noticed the increasing use of Mandarin Chinese in New York City&#8217;s Chinatowns, but <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/4294762.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.startribune.com/stories/484/4294762.html', 'this article']);" >this article</a> says that this is true even of San Francisco:

> A gradual shift from Cantonese, a dialect spoken in southern China, to China&#8217;s official language has been taking place in America&#8217;s Chinese communities &#8211;even in San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown, long a bastion of Cantonese speakers.
> 
> &#8230; Statistics document the shift: A 1986 consumer survey found that almost 70 percent of Chinese households in the San Francisco area spoke Cantonese; 19 percent spoke Mandarin. A survey last year showed the divide narrowing to 53 percent Cantonese and 47 percent Mandarin, according to a study for KTSF, a television station that devotes most of its programming to Asian-language shows.
> 
> The trend is similar in Los Angeles and New York, the nation&#8217;s two other major Chinese markets, said Saul Gitlin of Kang & Lee Advertising in New York. &#8220;Ten or 15 years ago, Mandarin would have been very, very small,&#8221; he said.

What the article doesn&#8217;t discuss, and I would be interested in knowing, is how Chinese language learning trends of Chinese immigrants are changing.
