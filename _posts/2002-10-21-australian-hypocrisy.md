>   &#8220;Howard&#8217;s openly racist policies have again begun to isolate Australia. He has deployed Australian troops against helpless, mostly Muslim,asylum-seekers on the high seas &#8211; more than 350 people went to their deaths in a leaking boat last year even though, as it has now been revealed, Australian military intelligence knew they were in great peril. He has imprisoned many of those who have reached Australia (mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, the countries he claims to be "liberating") in desert concentration camps in conditions which, reported a United Nations inspector, were among the worst he had seen in more than 40 inspections around the world.
