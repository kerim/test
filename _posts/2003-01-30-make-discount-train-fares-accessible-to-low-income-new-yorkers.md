The NY Straphangers campaign as <a href="http://www.straphangers.org/discount.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.straphangers.org/discount.html', 'some interesting ideas']);" >some interesting ideas</a> about how to change the MetroCard fare system used on New York City mass transit. Currently many low-income riders cannot afford to pay the $63 for a monthly pass! Discounted bi-weekly passes would address this issue! (More suggestions on <a href="http://www.straphangers.org/discount.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.straphangers.org/discount.html', 'their site']);" >their site</a>.)


>   Nearly one-half (45%) of lower-income riders surveyed who use a 7-day pass said that the cost of a 30-day card is a &#8220;very important&#8221; reason for not buying a 30-day pass. A bi-weekly pass priced at $31.50&#8212;one-half the cost of the monthly pass&#8212;makes the savings of the current 30-day pass more accessible to lower-income riders
