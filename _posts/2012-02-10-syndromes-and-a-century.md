Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndromes_and_a_Century" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndromes_and_a_Century', 'Syndromes and a Century']);" >Syndromes and a Century</a> แสงศตวรรษ is really two films—with overlapping (but different) characters and dialog—set in two different locations. Below are pictures of the scene of a dentist and his patient (a Buddhist monk) from each of the two films.

In many ways these two pictures sum up what makes this such a powerful film. It is a reflection on space and light and location. In the first film the dentist sings a song to his patient while cleaning his teeth. In the second film the patient struggles to remove the head covering which he finds uncomfortable. It is not a film that is naive about rural life, which is shown to have its own problems—people worry about money and relationships. But it is a reflection on how space and light and location affect the nature of human relationships. The film doesn&#8217;t have any single plot or story line tying everything together, but the individual scenes are so richly observed that the film is deeply enjoyable.
