Today&#8217;s *New York Times* <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/world/europe/01stockholm.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/world/europe/01stockholm.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all', 'article about how Swedes are choosing new names']);" >article about how Swedes are choosing new names</a> for themselves probably belongs in the large folder of non-trend trend articles in the Times. (&#8220;Last year, there were 7,257 name changes&#8221; out of a population of over nine millionâ€¦) But be that as it may, it gives me an excuse to link to my favorite story from the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4HB5a3z-U2sC&lpg=PA28&ots=fPMLshplhm&dq=lonely+planet+iceland+Vladimir+Ashkenazy&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4HB5a3z-U2sC&lpg=PA28&ots=fPMLshplhm&dq=lonely+planet+iceland+Vladimir+Ashkenazy&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false', 'Lonely Planet guide to Iceland']);" >Lonely Planet guide to Iceland</a>:

> It&#8217;s also forbidden to bestow non-Icelandic or foreign-sounding names upon Icelandic children. Even foreign immigrants must take on Icelandic names before citizenship will be granted. The only exception ever made was for conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy (**which led a subsequent immigrant to request the new Icelandic name &#8216;Vladimir Ashkenazy&#8217;!**).

(Thanks to John Emerson for pointing out the percentages.)
