In 1996, CSX lent Snow $25.4 million to buy stock. Snow put up $7 million of his own money as a down payment. When CSX stock later tanked, the company generously forgave the loan and returned Snow&#8217;s $7 million down payment &#8212; not exactly a deal available to the average unlucky shareholder. What a perfect nominee for the Enron era. Ironically, Snow supervised a recent Conference Board report on corporate governance.&#8221;
