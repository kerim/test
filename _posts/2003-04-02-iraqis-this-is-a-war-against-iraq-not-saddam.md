Why do you expect me to celebrate?&#8221;

Putting people like <a href="http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1169" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1169', 'Jay Garner']);" >Jay Garner</a> in power doesn&#8217;t help change that image.
