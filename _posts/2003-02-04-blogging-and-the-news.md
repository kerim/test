>   All of which suggests the complementary, rather than alternative, role of blogging with respect to mainstream media. The central virtue of blogging, I&#8217;ve decided, is that in the proverbial agora, or online marketplace of ideas, bloggers are like Socrates on speed.

The mainstream media are being watched more closely because of bloggers &#8212; and kept more honest &#8212; and that can&#8217;t be a bad thing.

But I think that he misses one of the most important uses of blogs &#8211; which is simply the collection and redistribution of information. Bloggers are like information DJ&#8217;s who sort through all the stories other people don&#8217;t have time to read. The internet makes it possible to read thousands of different news sources a day &#8211; but who has the time? Blogging is the answer to this problem, helping people break out of the &#8220;daily paper&#8221; habit without having to read ten times as much! In this sense blogs like <a href="http://www.cursor.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cursor.org', 'Cursor']);" >Cursor</a> really stand out. I personally don&#8217;t care for much of the more verbose blogs who just add &#8220;spin&#8221; without much substance. Although some do find a nice balance, like <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/', 'Atrios']);" >Atrios</a>, or <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com', 'Tom Tomorrow']);" >Tom Tomorrow</a>.
