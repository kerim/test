This is the Chinese character for &#8220;proton&#8221; as in what is in the nucleus of an atom, pronounced &#8220;Zhi4zi3&#8243;. But my Chinese dictionary tells me that it has another, historical, meaning:


>   A prince sent to a neighboring state as a hostage.


Sometimes I really love the Chinese language.
