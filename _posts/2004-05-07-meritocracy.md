LanguageHat has a <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001320.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001320.php', 'wonderful analysis']);" >wonderful analysis</a> of a recent poem by John Ashbery, and how it differs from the poet&#8217;s early work.
