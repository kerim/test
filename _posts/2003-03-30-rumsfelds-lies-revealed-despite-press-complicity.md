>   The Bush crowd&#8217;s brazen Big Lie technique was much in evidence in Donald Rumsfeld&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; appearance this past Sunday. When Tim Russert began to ask the Defense Secretary about the &#8220;bombing of Baghdad,&#8221; Rummy interrupted him and exploded. &#8220;We were not bombing Baghdad,&#8221; insisted the man running the war, but &#8220;greater Baghdad&#8221; and military installations around the city&#8217;s periphery.

>     Rummy&#8217;s propaganda fantasy was immediately refuted in the next segment, when Russert cut to a live interview with Peter Arnett from the Iraqi capital. The former CNN star in Gulf War I, who heard the Rummy interview in his earpiece, told Russert that &#8220;while you were talking&#8221; to Rumsfeld, several jets had flown overhead, immediately followed by explosions &#8212; Arnett said pointedly &#8212; &#8220;in Baghdad.&#8221; But Russert didn&#8217;t bother to point out the obvious contradiction between the live report and Rummy&#8217;s Orwellian assertion.
