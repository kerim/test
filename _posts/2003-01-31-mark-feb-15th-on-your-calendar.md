**Saturday, February 15th** will be a world-wide day of action against the Bush Administration&#8217;s proposed war on Iraq. An unprecedented number of coordinated protests will be held around the globe: in Amsterdam, Athens, Bangkok, Barcelona, Belfast, Berlin, Brussels, Cairo, Copenhagen, Dublin, Glasgow, Helsinki, Istanbul, Jakarta, Johannesburg, London, Manila, Oslo, Paris, Ramallah, Rome, San Francisco, San Juan, Stockholm, Tallinn, Tokyo, Vienna, Warsaw, and dozens of other cities.

JOIN US in **New York City** for a massive march and rally that will show the depth and breadth of U.S. opposition to this war.
