Following on my <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000021.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000021.html', 'marriage']);" >marriage</a> post, I think this link to <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_balkin_archive.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://balkin.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_balkin_archive.html', 'Balkinization']);" >Balkinization</a> deserves an entry of its own. Jack Balkin has an excellent post which clarifies a lot of the confusion surrounding the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in the sodomy case. Especially with regard to Kennedy&#8217;s attempt to strengthen Roe vs. Wade and the relationship between morality and privacy:


>   For the record, Lawrence extends the fundamental right of privacy to same-sex intimate relationships. It does not strike down Texas&#8217; sodomy law on the ground that it fails the test of rationality, as Justice Scalia seems to assume. Nor does it hold that appeals to morality cannot be a legitimate government interest under the rational basis test for ordinary social and economic legislation. Rather, it holds only that when a fundamental right or interest is involved moral disapproval is not a sufficient interest to overcome the fundamental right.
