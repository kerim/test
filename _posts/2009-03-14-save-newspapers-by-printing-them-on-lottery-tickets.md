Mother Jones <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2009/02/books-lottery-wars#comment-152825" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.motherjones.com/media/2009/02/books-lottery-wars#comment-152825', 'reports']);" >reports</a> that the average American household spends about $500 per year on lottery tickets &#8211; more than on movies, books, and music combined. 

So my idea to save newspapers is to print them on lottery tickets! Or, more precisely, make each page of the newspaper a lottery ticket by printing a number on it. If you get an annual subscription you could have your own number printed on each page instead of a random one!

Perhaps not the most noble solution, but it is not unlike what Taiwan did when it wanted to encourage people to start properly recording transactions. Each electronic receipt in Taiwan has a lottery number printed on it. This means that customers want their receipts. Other companies will even collect your receipts for the increased chance of winning the lottery. This is also good for newspapers as it might inspire companies to collect and recycle discarded newspapers.
