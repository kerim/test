>   &#8220;According to our most recent survey of Consumer Reports readers, 5 percent bought a computer that was completely inoperable within the first month; another 11 percent said they had problems in the first month but the computer was usable. The chart below shows the percentage of computers bought over the past five years that ever had a repair to original components. Our findings have been consistent in recent years. However, a brand&#8217;s repair history includes models that may have been more or less reliable than others. Repair histories also can&#8217;t anticipate design or manufacturing changes. Still, we think you&#8217;ll better your chance of getting a reliable computer if you choose a brand that has been reliable in the past.&#8221;
