This was reported a long time ago by &#8220;In These Times&#8221;, I&#8217;m glad that the case is finally making it to the courts.


>   &#8220;Italian police have been accused of fabricating evidence against anti-globalisation protesters at last year&#8217;s G8 summit in Genoa by planting petrol bombs at their headquarters and falsely accusing them of stabbing a police officer. 
>   
>   
>     According to a magistrates&#8217; investigation, the police improvised lies to justify a bloodsoaked raid at the Diaz school, which was being used by protesters as a headquarters. The raid, which left dozens injured after being kicked, punched and beaten with batons, prompted an international outcry.&#8221;
