Teresa at Making Light has a <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008402.html#008402" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008402.html#008402', 'great post']);" >great post</a> about how deaf people are using YouTube:

> Why did it not occur to me that the signing deaf would be using YouTube as a public forum? This is transformational. Many of them arenâ€™t comfortably fluent in written language. For many more, sign is and always will be their first language. YouTube gives them an easy, expressive, unmediated channel for many-to-many communication.
