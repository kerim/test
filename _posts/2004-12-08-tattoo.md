Right now I&#8217;m double checking all the Chinese text in my dissertation, so I was happy to see this post in <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001689.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001689.html', 'Languagelog']);" >Languagelog</a>:

> <a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hanzismatter.com/', 'Hanzi Smatter']);" >Hanzi Smatter</a> is a blog &#8220;[d]edicated to the misuse of Chinese characters (Hanzi or Kanji) in Western culture&#8221;.

A lot of the site is devoted to tattoos.

> For example, an entry from December 1 pictures someone who meant to tattoo 精 (jing1) &#8220;essence, semen, spirit &#8221; on his elbows, but by splitting the character into the two radicals 米 (mi3) &#8220;uncooked rice&#8221; and 青 (qing1 or jing1) &#8220;blue, green, black; young&#8221;, managed instead to display &#8220;green rice&#8221;.

I know of a woman in my yoga class who has such an incorrect Chinese tattoo on her neck. I&#8217;ll have to ask if I can take a picture of it and send it in to the site. I forget the full phrase she wanted, but instead of &#8220;good&#8221; 好 she only got the half of the character which means &#8220;woman&#8221; 女, making nonsense of the whole thing.

My advice: If you are going to get a Chinese character tattooed on your body, first find a Chinese speaking friend to proofread it for you. For my dissertation I decided to take advantage of Unicode and to provide both the Chinese characters and the phonetic transcription (including tone marks) wherever I introduce a translated phrase or proper name. This isn&#8217;t a standard practice &#8211; it is much more work, but I think it will make it easier for many Chinese speakers to read my dissertation. It will also make it easier for non-Chinese speakers to then conduct research based on my dissertation. I was inspired by the decision of *<a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/', 'the Taipei Times']);" >the Taipei Times</a>* to start including Chinese characters immediately after the names. But I couldn&#8217;t have done this without the help of a Taiwanese friend who has graciously agreed to help me proofread all of this.

Two more days!
