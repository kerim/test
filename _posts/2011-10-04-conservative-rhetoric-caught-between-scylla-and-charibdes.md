With regard to the economy, conservatives always preach restraint in the face of forces beyond our control, warning of unintended consequences if we overreach.

E.g. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/opinion/brooks-the-planning-fallacy.html?_r=1&ref=opinion" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/opinion/brooks-the-planning-fallacy.html?_r=1&ref=opinion', 'David Brooks']);" >David Brooks</a>:

> But you **don’t have the power to transform the whole situation**. Your discrete goods might contribute to an overall turnaround, but that turnaround will be **beyond your comprehension and control**.

With regard to war, however, conservatives always insist on the need to act, no matter what. If you don&#8217;t support their morally, legally, politically, and strategically questionable course of action they insist that inaction is not a possibility—daring you to offer up a slightly-less-horrible course of action instead.

E.g. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/10/anwar_al_awlaki_when_is_it_acceptable_to_kill_a_u_s_citizen_susp.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2011/10/anwar_al_awlaki_when_is_it_acceptable_to_kill_a_u_s_citizen_susp.html', 'Christopher Hitchens']);" >Christopher Hitchens</a>:

> As we engage with the horrible idea that our government claims the right to add its own citizens to a death list that is compiled by methods and standards unknown, we must concede that no government on earth faces such a temptation to invoke what I suppose we could call a doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Those who share my alarm at the prospect of this, and of the ways in which it could be abused, are **under a heavy obligation to say what they would do instead.**
