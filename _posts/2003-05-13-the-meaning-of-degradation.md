>   To recite from a Pentagon press release that an Iraqi division has been &#8220;degraded by 70 percent&#8221; is an astounding abdication of journalistic responsibility. A journalist these days must not just report the facts, but also explain the news, give it color and significance. The graphic reality of &#8220;degradation&#8221; is a large pile of dismembered bodies. Surely some picture or explanation of what the wiping out of an entire division with high explosives actually looks like is called for.
