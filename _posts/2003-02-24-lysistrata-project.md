>   In case you are not up to date on this, on March 3, 2003, hundreds of performances of Aristophanes&#8217; bawdy comedy will be presented as a &#8220;worldwide act of theatrical dissent.&#8221; The Lysistrata Project was the brain child of a few theater people in NYC, but has grown beyond the wildest dreams of its initiators since its inception in January. At 10:00 am on February 24, the total was up to 681 readings in 41 countries, but every day another few readings have been added to the list <a href="http://www.pecosdesign.com/lys/cities.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pecosdesign.com/lys/cities.html', 'here']);" >here</a> . In addition to performances in every state of the USA, readings are scheduled in Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Jerusalem, Beirut, Buenos Aires, and Damascus, Syria. There are four separate groups rehearsing for performances in my own small city of Syracuse, New York.

>     For those who are unfamiliar with the play, the women of Athens and other Greek city-states stop a war by agreeing to withhold sex from their men until they sign a truce. Lysistrata is so ancient and so explicitly bawdy that translators and playwrights have generated many versions over the years. The <a href="http://www.pecosdesign.com/lys/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pecosdesign.com/lys/', 'Lysistrata Project site']);" >Lysistrata Project site</a> includes links to over a dozen scripts, including re-tellings suitable for elementary or high school students.
