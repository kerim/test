When supplies run low during the summer months, the Israeli water company, Mekorot, simply shuts off the valves that supply Palestinian towns. This means settlers get their swimming pools topped up while Palestinian villages a few miles away run out of drinking water.

When tensions are high &#8212; as they are now &#8212; the situation becomes unbearable, especially for the 25 per cent of Palestinian villages that were never connected to a water supply.
