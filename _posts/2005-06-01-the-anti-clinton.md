John Edwards is <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/section/tableforone" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tpmcafe.com/section/tableforone', 'guest blogging']);" >guest blogging</a> over at the new <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tpmcafe.com', 'TPM Cafe']);" >TPM Cafe</a> web site. If I was luke warm about him as a presidential candidate, all that has changed. He is clearly taking poverty seriously and putting forward concrete examples about what can be done to lift people out of poverty (and the answer isn&#8217;t that they should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps).

They pay more for groceries and gasoline. They pay more for furniture and appliances. They pay higher prices for insurance and for utilities. And—something that has troubled me for a long time—they pay more for financial services, whether it’s cashing a check or getting a loan.
