I don&#8217;t publish much about the environment on this blog &#8211; I guess because protection seems like such an obvious good and the government&#8217;s policies are so obviously bad that it seems to require little comment. However <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/22/MN252797.DTL&#38;type=printable" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/22/MN252797.DTL&type=printable', 'this article']);" >this article</a> about Christie Whitman&#8217;s resignation is worth reading:


>   Christie Whitman&#8217;s resignation Wednesday as chief of the Environmental Protection Agency alarmed conservationists who fear that an administration viewed as having little sympathy for environmental protection will be even less likely in the future to crack down on polluters.


Basically, things are going to go from bad to worse&#8230;
