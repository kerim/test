I haven&#8217;t been blogging about Sinclair since so many <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/', 'other people']);" >other people</a> have been <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Sinclair_Broadcast_Group', 'doing it']);" >doing it</a> better. But I think it is exciting to report that the blogsphere has had a big impact already:

> <a href="http://sbgweb2.sbgnet.com/index.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sbgweb2.sbgnet.com/index.shtml', 'Sinclair Broadcast']);" >Sinclair Broadcast</a>, as you may have heard, is planning to air an anti-Kerry movie on prime time just before the election, passing it off as &#8220;news&#8221;. However, a boycott campaign &#8212; <a href="http://www.boycottsbg.com/default.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boycottsbg.com/default.htm', 'boycottsbg.com']);" >boycottsbg.com</a> &#8212; has been put together and publicized online by bloggers and indy news sites over the past ten days; most significantly, the Kerry campaign has learned some lessons from Dean and leveraged <a href="http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/003343.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/003343.html', 'their blog']);" >their blog</a> to push the boycott. As of today, <a href="http://www.boycottsbg.com/default.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boycottsbg.com/default.htm', 'boycottsbg.com']);" >boycottsbg.com</a> claims that eighty companies have pulled their ad money from Sinclair; also, as <a href="http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/20208/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/20208/', 'AlterNet']);" >AlterNet</a> reports, Sinclair stock &#8220;dropped 10 percent over the past week, closing on Friday at an all-time low of $7.04 â€“ a $60 million loss in value.&#8221; A vivid example of how the net is changing politics&#8211;when was the last time you saw a boycott that strong happen in ten days?
