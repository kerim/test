No posts today because I spent my blogging-time trying to categorize all the blogs which have piled up in <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62', 'my &#8220;More blogs &#8230;&#8221; section']);" >my &#8220;More blogs &#8230;&#8221; section</a>. Eventually, I hope to move some of these to the main page, but I&#8217;m waiting for the next version of <a href="http://lbstone.com/apb/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lbstone.com/apb/', 'the software I use to manage my bookmarks']);" >the software I use to manage my bookmarks</a>, which might take some time.

If you have any suggestions for additional blogs, or comments on my categories, let me know! Now that there is some structure to the list, I hope to add more blogs.
