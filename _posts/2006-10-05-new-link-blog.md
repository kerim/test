Since their recent <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html', 'upgrade']);" >upgrade</a>, I&#8217;ve switched from using my desktop client, NetNews Wire, to using <a href="http://reader.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://reader.google.com/', 'Google Reader']);" >Google Reader</a> online, something I was never willing to do with any previous online RSS client I&#8217;ve tried. It is still in Google Labs, which means it hasn&#8217;t even graduated to a proper &#8220;beta&#8221; software product and so still has some rough edges, but so far I&#8217;m pretty pleased with it.

One cool thing is that this allows me to create a &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/13948370226140918659" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/reader/shared/13948370226140918659', 'clip blog']);" >clip blog</a>&#8221; of all those stories I find interesting, but simply don&#8217;t have the time to blog about. Accordingly, I&#8217;ve replaced my old &#8220;side blog&#8221; with a new one that will be updated much more often with much more content (as long as I continue to use Google Reader). Look over on the right side of this page.

If you prefer, you can read all the posts to the link blog on <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/13948370226140918659" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/reader/shared/13948370226140918659', 'their own web page']);" >their own web page</a>! You can also subscribe to it via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com//KerimsClips" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://feeds.feedburner.com//KerimsClips', 'its RSS feed']);" >its RSS feed</a>. (If you subscribed to my old sideblog RSS feed you should update your links.)

PS: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I know the styling is a bit off, I&#8217;m working on it &#8230; if you know some CSS maybe you can help out?</span> UPDATE: Thanks to the Feedburner staff for their help!
