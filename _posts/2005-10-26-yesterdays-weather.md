The way weather reports work is all wrong. They always tell you the next three-to-five days. What I want is just two days, and one of those days should be yesterday! That&#8217;s right, I don&#8217;t want to know the future, I want to know the past, or, more precisely, how the present compares with the past. Will today be colder? wetter? windier? If I was cold yesterday (and I was) should I wear more or less layers today?

Weather is such an abstract concept. I have no idea what 55Â°F means on any given day. But I do know what it meant for me yesterday, so just tell me: Will it be the same, or different?

Some web sites do give you access to <a href="http://www.weather.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.weather.com', 'yesterday&#8217;s weather']);" >yesterday&#8217;s weather</a>, but I&#8217;ve never seen anything that gives you a comparison of yesterday&#8217;s weather with today&#8217;s, or which even shows them side-by-side.
