A few days ago I <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1152" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1152', 'linked']);" >linked</a> to an article about &#8220;Jay Garner, the retired US general who will oversee humanitarian relief and reconstruction in postwar Iraq.&#8221; Since then some more information has come out which makes things look even worse:

First, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15512" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15512', 'Ian Williams']);" >Ian Williams</a> writes:


>   Garner has always been a die-hard advocate of all things military &#8211; sometimes at the expense of the facts.

>     &#8230;The man who will be in charge of the disarmament of Iraq was also a fervent proponent of the fatally flawed Star Wars missile defense system, touting its virtues even when the results of its testing were later revealed to be rigged.

And guess what? His company got a Star Wars contract &#8230;

And both Ian Williams and <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,925325,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,925325,00.html', 'the Observer']);" >the Observer</a> comment on his strong pro-Israeli views:


>   Garner&#8217;s links with Israel are not limited to missile programmes. In October 2000 he put his name to a statement that said that &#8216;Israel had exercised remarkable restraint in the face of lethal violence orchestrated by the leadership of a Palestinian Authority&#8217;.  
>   
>   
>     The organisation behind the statement was the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, which includes Cheney and Richard Perle, another arch-hawk, among its advisers past and present.
>   


Views, it turns out, which may have a lot to do with Israel&#8217;s good record on purchasing Patriot missiles, and other lucrative (but foolish) arms deals he advocated&#8230;
