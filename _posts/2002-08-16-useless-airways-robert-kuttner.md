There is a <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V13-16.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/print/V13-16.html', 'related article']);" >related article</a> on the telecommunications industry by Paull Starr in the new TAP, but it is not yet online.


>   &#8220;What&#8217;s truly amazing is that US Airways could go bankrupt, despite tactics that would make an old-fashioned robber-baron monopolist blush. For instance, US Airways has a monopoly on nonstops between Washington and Boston. It charges around $670 for a basic roundtrip fare. It controls 74 percent of flights in and out of Philadelphia, and charges as much as $550 for a roundtrip flight between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pa. It is literally cheaper, and almost as fast, to take a taxi.

>     The airlines are suffering (along with the passengers) not because of bad management but because this industry, like telecommunications, was never a good candidate for deregulation. Either there is genuine competition &#8212; in which case passengers get good deals and carriers go broke &#8212; or the airlines find ways to accumulate monopoly power and consumers get snookered. Competition just doesn&#8217;t produce a happy medium. Sometimes, as in the case of US Airways, there is simultaneously the worst of both worlds: monopoly power over and exorbitant prices on some routes without enough income to make up for the ruinous competition on others.&#8221;
