>     Many of the Asian-American and Latina books had lots of incense and spirits &#8212; "ancient Asian wisdom" and religious tidbits, or mystical realism in the form of pissed-off ghosts and fantastic visions. They also featured nearly pornographic discussions of food; Isabel Allende&#8217;s "Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses" even had recipes. The mystical stuff and the food seem to reflect the reasons why some white people are drawn to different cultures &#8212; either in search of religious or spiritual enlightenment, or to exhibit their open-minded adventuresome selves by eating our food. Our cultures are tagged as "better" somehow &#8212; closer to the earth, purer, more attuned to sensory pleasure &#8212; but in nice, non-threatening ways, wrapped up neatly in fortune-cookie wisdom or duck tamales.&#8221;
