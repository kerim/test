> A military report into the Abu Ghraib case &#8211; parts of which were made available to the Guardian &#8211; makes it clear that private contractors were supervising interrogations in the prison, which was notorious for torture and executions under Saddam Hussein.
> 
> One civilian contractor was accused of raping a young male prisoner but has not been charged because military law has no jurisdiction over him.
