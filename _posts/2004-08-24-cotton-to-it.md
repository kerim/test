I didn&#8217;t even realize that cotton was a verb. From *The American Heritage Dictionary*:

> To come to understand. Often used with to or onto: &#8220;The German bosses . . . never cottoned to such changes&#8221; (N.R. Kleinfield).

The context in which I came across this is a joke, since it is the title of an article about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10047-2004Aug18.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10047-2004Aug18.html', 'an experiment involving political T-shirts']);" >an experiment involving political T-shirts</a>:

> **T-Shirt Diversity? Bush Won&#8217;t Cotton to It.**<img src="http://test.oxus.net/images/prather.jpg" height="136" width="98" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="prather wearing a t-shirt" />â€¢ The question: Which presidential campaign better tolerates dissent?

> The experiment: A college professor wears a Kerry-Edwards shirt to a rally for President Bush, then a Bush for President shirt to a John Kerry rally.
> 
> Result: Bush people make the subject remove his shirt, then give him the boot. The Kerry people don&#8217;t make a peep.
