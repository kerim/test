Coffee is the second largest US import after oil, and the US consumes one-fifth of all the world&#8217;s coffee, making it the largest consumer in the world. But few Americans realize that agriculture workers in the coffee industry often toil in what can be described as &#8220;sweatshops in the fields.&#8221; Many small coffee farmers receive prices for their coffee that are less than the costs of production, forcing them into a cycle of poverty and debt.
