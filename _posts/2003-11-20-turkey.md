More than 80,000 supermarket workers are fighting to protect health care benefits as their employers&#8211;grocery super-chains like Safeway-owned Vons, Albertsons and Kroger-controlled Ralph&#8217;s&#8211;attempt to cut their health care&#8211;driving these workers into poverty.

The AFL-CIO has set up a national strike support fund to help these workers.&nbsp; The fund is raising money to buy Thanksgiving turkeys for the strikers and their families. Please consider donating to help the grocery workers by clicking on the link below.
