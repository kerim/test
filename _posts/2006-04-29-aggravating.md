<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/', '']);"  title="12 Angry Men"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/137187279_2e1c838620.jpg" width="500" height="346" alt="12 Angry Men" /></a>

Having never served on a jury, my knowledge mostly comes from the movie, &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/', '12 Angry Men']);" >12 Angry Men</a>&#8220;. But I&#8217;ve always found the instructions given to juries fairly odd. They seem to imply a very strange idealized notions of language, thought, and discourse that have no bearing on reality. It is as if they were written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas', 'Habermas']);" >Habermas</a>.

Take, for instance, this recent *Washington Post* <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800845_pf.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800845_pf.html', 'article']);" >article</a> about a juror in the Moussaoui trial. A juror got in trouble for looking up a word in the dictionary. The Moussaoui jury is charged with weighing &#8220;aggravating factors&#8221; against &#8220;mitigating factors&#8221; in determining whether or not he should be sentenced to death. So one jury member looked up the word &#8220;aggravating&#8221; in a dictionary.

> As it turned out, the juror&#8217;s extracurricular research Thursday night had been forbidden by the judge. When jurors on Tuesday asked whether they could have a dictionary, she told them they were not allowed to do any independent investigating at home.
> 
> &#8230;As [U.S. District Judge Leonie M.] Brinkema explained again yesterday to the 12-member panel, deliberations could be skewed if one juror knows more than the rest. &#8220;What that would do is change your role as jurors,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You would then become advocates for one side or the other.&#8221; 

The definition of &#8220;independent investigation&#8221; is rather vague. Is looking up a word in a dictionary really research? Such confusions are not an uncommon event. In fact, there was even a recent post about <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003029.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003029.html', 'just this problem']);" >just this problem</a> by Roger Shuy over at Language Log. He points out that linguists have been writing about this issue for several decades:

> Robert and Veda Charrow started it off back in the 1970s with research that showed that jurors were generally confused and even misinformed by jury instructions (Columbia Law Review, 79:7: 1306-1374). Many others since have followed up on this topic, including Peter Tiersma&#8217;s recent work with the California Judicial Counsel&#8217;s Task Force on Jury Instructions. Judges worry about giving jury instructions that might get the case overturned on appeal but one must wonder why it is that jurors can&#8217;t be told what confusing instructions really mean. At least part of the problem stems from law&#8217;s apparent need to use legal language to non-lawyers even when they don&#8217;t understand it. The concepts of register change and participant perspective don&#8217;t seem to occur to them. Tiersma&#8217;s book, Legal Language (Chicago, 1999) details this issue at length. It&#8217;s a very important book.

However, even assuming that jurors can understand the instructions given to them (with or without a dictionary), I&#8217;ve always found the attempt to control what information juries pay attention to quite odd. Even if certain facts of the case at hand might be hidden from a jury, people&#8217;s general knowledge of the circumstances surrounding any particular case are likely to vary considerably &#8211; as is their vocabulary and general level of knowledge.

One issue at hand is the extent to which educated people are excluded from juries. Some scholars worry that this is a <a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/amar/20040220.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://writ.news.findlaw.com/amar/20040220.html', 'problem']);" >problem</a>, although one recent <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=704562" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=704562', 'study']);" >study</a> suggests that if it is a problem it may have to do with other factors besides the jury selection process &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t seem to exclude the educated. (They may be less likely to serve for other reasons however.)

Having never served on a jury myself I think I would find such requirements quite stifling. After all, I&#8217;m the kind of person who rushes to Wikipedia several times a day. If I had to deliberate on someone&#8217;s life without access to such resources I would be pretty angry.
