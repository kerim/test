Here is a good piece by Slate&#8217;s <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2080628/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2080628/', 'Mickey Kaus']);" >Mickey Kaus</a> about why Rumsfeld would want to send less troops than the military thought was necessary (Scroll down to Sunday, March 30, 2003&#8243;):


>   If &#8220;regime change&#8221; in Iraq were the only goal, there&#8217;d be no reason not to provide plenty of soldiers to do the job, with an ample margin of safety. But regime change in Iraq isn&#8217;t the only goal. Rather, neocons in the Bush administration see the Iraq campaign as the opening move in a series of potential power plays that might involve at least credibly threatening military action against Syria, North Korea, Iran, and maybe even Saudi Arabia. The first two threats have already, in fact, been issued (and I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t good reasons to want to be able to intimidate some of these countries &#8212; e.g. North Korea &#8212; even while fighting an Iraq-sized war).

But if we can topple a heavily-defended government in Iraq with a light, quick non-Powellesque force &#8212; using but a small portion of our strength &#8212; then taking on multiple targets suddenly becomes a real possibility, and a real threat to regimes in Tehran, Damascus, and Pyongyang.
