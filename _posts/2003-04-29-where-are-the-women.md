>   One of the things that struck me watching the crowds tearing down the statues of Saddam Hussein was that I didn&#8217;t see any women. Another thing that struck me was that no one commented on this &#8212; as if streets without women were entirely normal. Pardon my stereotypically feminist response, but to me a world wiped clean of women is a little disturbing. It seems to say, &#8220;Here is the future of Iraq. And people of your gender aren&#8217;t in it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to be a party-pooper, but it seems that about 65% of Iraq didn&#8217;t get its invitation to the party.
