Its funny how things seem to happen in the news just when I&#8217;ve seen a film about the topic. This weekend I watched John Sayles latest film, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286179" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286179', 'Sunshine State']);" >Sunshine State</a> in which one of the main characters is a former Weeki Wachee Mermaid. Then, just today, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_08_01_archive.html#200443956" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://boingboing.net/2003_08_01_archive.html#200443956', 'BoingBoing']);" >BoingBoing</a> ran a post linking to an <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/951625.asp?0ql=c9p" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/951625.asp?0ql=c9p', 'MSNBC news story']);" >MSNBC news story</a> about how the Weeki Wachee Mermaids are now an endangered species. I&#8217;m not sure I really care &#8211; except that watching the news clip you realize just how thoroughly Sayles researches his films. Not just the place, but even the people interviewed in the news story remind one of the film. His plots may seem contrived at times, but his characters never do.
