I can&#8217;t stand *A Prairie Home Companion*, but it wasn&#8217;t something I was going to blog about until <a href="http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2005/09/13/15.49.56/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://triptronix.net/ishbadiddle/archives/2005/09/13/15.49.56/', 'Ish']);" >Ish</a> brought my attention to the fact that Garrison Keillor is <a href="http://www.mnspeak.com/mnspeak/archive/post-733.cfm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mnspeak.com/mnspeak/archive/post-733.cfm', 'suing some blogger']);" >suing some blogger</a> for making a T-Shirt which reads: &#8220;A Prairie Ho Companion.&#8221; I think the blogger is right that it falls within fair use. I even think it was nice of him to warn Garrison&#8217;s lawyer that the whole thing was going to blow up in his face (as this post demonstrates).

All this gives me a chance to finally blog about this &#8220;<a href="http://www.poems.com/keilaugu.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.poems.com/keilaugu.htm', 'thoroughly enjoyable assault']);" >thoroughly enjoyable assault</a> on Garrison Keillor&#8217;s Writer&#8217;s Almanac&#8221; which Language Hat <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002020.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002020.php', 'blogged']);" >blogged</a> about last month. Here are some choice quotations:

> Now, had Keillor not &#8220;strayed off the reservation&#8221; and kept to his *Prairie Home Companion* show with its Norwegian bachelor farmers and Lutheran bake sales (a sort of *Spoon River Anthology* as presented by the Hallmark Hall of Fame), comfort food for the philistines, a contemporary, bittersweet equivalent to the Lawrence Welk Show of years past, I&#8217;d have left him alone. But the indefatigable and determined purveyor of homespun wisdom has wandered into the realm of fire, and for his trespass must be burned.
> 
> &#8230; Everything that comes out of his mouth in that treacly baritone, which occasionally releases into a highpitched, breathless tremolo when he wants to convey emotion, is a sermon. &#8230; Everything Keillor does is about reassurance, containment, continuity. He makes no demands on his audiences, none whatsoever. To do so would only be bad manners. &#8230; Keillor is infatuated with the idea of poetry but knows and cares little or nothing about the art, what&#8217;s good, what&#8217;s bad, and how it&#8217;s made &#8230; 

And so on.

OK. I got that out of my system now.
