I wrote a post back in March about how Taiwanese politics was <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/03/27/food/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/03/27/food/', 'all about food']);" >all about food</a>. Well, today the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3689110.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3689110.stm', 'BBC reports']);" >BBC reports</a> that the ministry of defense is responding to attacks that money spent on new weapons systems could be better spent on social services and education by declaring that it isn&#8217;t spending any more money that Taiwanese spend on &#8230; bubble tea [珍珠奶茶 &#8211; literally &#8220;pearl milk tea&#8221;]. I haven&#8217;t done the math, but I imagine it is correct (even if the logic isn&#8217;t).

> In a leaflet campaign, the ministry says that Taiwan could save enough money to buy the arms if everyone drank one less cup of Taiwan&#8217;s popular pearl or bubble tea over the next 15 years.
> 
> The tea, which features chewy tapioca balls sucked up through a straw, was invented in Taiwan and has recently become a popular drink overseas. 

A brief history of Bubble Tea can be found <a href="http://www.bubbleteasupply.com/index.php?page=what.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bubbleteasupply.com/index.php?page=what.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.

UPDATE: What wasn&#8217;t clear from the BBC article was that the protesters <a href="http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&#38;storyId=926717&#38;tw=wn_wire_story" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&storyId=926717&tw=wn_wire_story', 'brought Bubble Tea with them to the protest']);" >brought Bubble Tea with them to the protest</a>. Of course they did! (Thanks to <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/25/bubble-tea/#comment-1356" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/25/bubble-tea/#comment-1356', 'JJ']);" >JJ</a>.)
