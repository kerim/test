My favorite <a href="http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&#38;pid=1891" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=1891', 'quote']);" >quote</a> from last night&#8217;s debate:

> The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didn&#8217;t have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we&#8217;d used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That&#8217;s the war against terror.

UPDATE: Here&#8217;s some post-debate <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004897.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004897.php', 'fact-checking']);" >fact-checking</a>.
