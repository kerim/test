We are very happy to announce that, in an effort to ensure that as many people as possible see our film, we are now offering <a href="http://dontbeatmesir.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dontbeatmesir.com', 'Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir!']);" >Please Don&#8217;t Beat Me, Sir!</a> for online streaming via <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir', 'Vimeo On Demand']);" >Vimeo On Demand</a>. On Demand is a brand new distribution platform from Vimeo which allows you to watch films streaming on the web, smartphones, tablets, and on web-connected TVs (like Roku).

We hate paying for things which we don’t get to keep, so we are especially pleased that Vimeo offers filmmakers the option of including file downloads as well as online streaming. If you <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir', 'watch our film online']);" >watch our film online</a> on Vimeo you can also download a copy of the film to your own hard drive and watch it whenever and wherever you want.

Since we first released the DVD people have been asking us about online access, and after looking at all the available options we feel that Vimeo On Demand offers users the best possible viewing experience. If you haven’t seen the film yet, we hope that the ease of using Vimeo On Demand will convince you to watch it today! If you do <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://vimeo.com/ondemand/dontbeatmesir', 'watch it on Vimeo']);" >watch it on Vimeo</a>, please be sure to let others know how much you like it by leaving a review.

Although Vimeo On Demand splits revenue 90/10 with the filmmaker, there is a hefty annual fee. For this reason we aren’t sure how long we will be able to keep the film online, so consider this a limited-time experiment. We don’t expect to turn a profit, but we do need to break-even…

Online streaming via Vimeo as well as the downloadable movie file are intended only for individual viewers. We ask that those interested in holding public screenings of the film, such as classroom use, continue to purchase the DVD via our via our <a href="http://fournineandahalf.com/pleasedontbeatmesir/purchase/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fournineandahalf.com/pleasedontbeatmesir/purchase/', 'website']);" >website</a>. We offer discounts on DVD purchases by individuals, non-profits, and community colleges.
