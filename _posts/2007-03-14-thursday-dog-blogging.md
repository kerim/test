I honestly don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be blogging about Juno every Thursday, but since she takes up so much of my blogging time I figure I might as well share some of these photos. Juno&#8217;s a fast learner and she&#8217;s quickly becoming much more manageable. Of course, when another dog is around that all goes out the window, but there is definite improvement.

I have to admit, taking a hike by the lake in the morning sure beats scanning Google Reader for the latest news.

Juno&#8217;s favorite new toy.

She regularly gets stuck under the bed trying to fish the ball out.

There are way too many stray dogs around. That&#8217;s one reason why we go all the way up into the mountains for our walks. Now she&#8217;s going into heat for the first time, so we had better keep an eye on her over the next few weeks &#8211; and get her spayed as soon as possible. Its going to be a nightmare keeping these guys away from her!
