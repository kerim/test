Read this quote by Harvard&#8217;s President. It clearly amounts to an equation of anti-Israeli criticism to anti-Semitism. This is no way to encourage free an open debate in academia&#8230;


>   &#8220;"Serious and thoughtful people are advocating and taking actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent," said Mr. Summers, referring both to the push for divestment and to actions by student organizations at Harvard and other campuses to raise money for groups found to have ties to terrorist groups.

>     "Where anti-Semitism and views that are profoundly anti-Israeli have traditionally been the primary preserve of poorly educated right-wing populists," he added, "profoundly anti-Israel views are increasingly finding support in progressive intellectual communities."&#8221;
