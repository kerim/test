I&#8217;ve written <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/25/distracted/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/25/distracted/', 'several']);" >several</a> <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/11/distraction/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/11/distraction/', 'times']);" >times</a> about how I wish the Kerry campaign would leave the Vietnam stuff behind and move on, so I&#8217;m a little embarrassed to be writing a post on the issue of Kerry&#8217;s Vietnam medals; however, I have good reason. For one thing, this <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/summary.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/summary.html', 'new web site']);" >new web site</a>, devoted to debunking the book *Unfit for Command*, is written by a friend. For another, he&#8217;s done an excellent job. And third, like it or not focusing on this issue seems to be part of Kerry&#8217;s strategy, and it seems to be <a href="http://www.bushlies.ws/2004/09/the_democratic.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bushlies.ws/2004/09/the_democratic.html', 'working']);" >working</a>.

Here&#8217;s how my friend <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/summary.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/summary.html', 'describes']);" >describes</a> his site (emphasis added):

> Much of the criticism of the Swift Boat Veterans for &#8220;Truth&#8221; has centered around their sources of funding and advice. This review uses a different tactic and **confronts them head on, on their own turf**. It incorporates a number of recently-released U.S. Navy documents not available on the Kerry/Edwards site, which are provided in PDF format.

In other words, if you are interested in this issue &#8211; as a lot of people seem to be, then this is a must-read site providing trenchant arguments and important new documentation. Please link to this site so that it shows up on Google for anyone interested in knowing the truth about the &#8220;truth&#8221;.
