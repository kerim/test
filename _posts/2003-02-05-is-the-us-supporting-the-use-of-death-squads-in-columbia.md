>   &#8230;this month the Colombian government will start to deploy a new kind of &#8220;self-defence force&#8221;, composed of armed civilians backed by the army. Human rights groups allege that the government has simply legalised the death squads.


also:


>   The United States has been at war in Colombia for over 50 years. It has, however, hesitated to explain precisely who it is fighting. Officially, it is now involved there in a &#8220;war on terror&#8221;. Before September 2001, it was a &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;; before that, a &#8220;war on communism&#8221;. In essence, however, US intervention in Colombia is unchanged: this remains, as it has always been, a war on the poor.
