It is already old news, having been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4512812.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4512812.stm', 'reported in the BBC']);" >reported in the BBC</a> over a year ago, but I just learned that Hindi movies are on the way out. With is focus on big budget (&#8220;<a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/01/18/crore/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/01/18/crore/', 'multi crore']);" >multi crore</a>&#8220;) spectaculars aimed at the transnational Indian audience (NRIs), Bollywood seems to have lost its way with viewers in India&#8217;s heartland. They have turned to films produced in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_language" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_language', 'Bhojpuri language']);" >Bhojpuri language</a>, which is related to Hindi, but retains is own distinctive characteristics.

While the BBC emphasizes the emphasis on &#8220;marriage and family,&#8221; my friend from Bihar was telling me that there might be a more radical reason for the popularity of these films, as they express the <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/01/22/suicide/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/01/22/suicide/', 'dissatisfaction']);" >dissatisfaction</a> of rural Indians &#8211; a topic that was popular in the Bollywood films of the 1970s, the only Bollywood films which are still watched in these areas.
