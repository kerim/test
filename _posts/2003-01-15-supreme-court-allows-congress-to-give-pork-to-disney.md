This is disappointing. It may be that the Supreeme Court was not the correct plact to fight this &#8211; but I wish it hadn&#8217;t happened.


>   &#8220;The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld lengthier copyrights protecting the profits of songs, books and cartoon characters &#8211; a huge victory for Disney and other companies. 
>   
>   
>     The 7-2 ruling, while not unexpected, was a blow to Internet publishers and others who wanted to make old books available online and use the likenesses of a Mickey Mouse cartoon and other old creations without paying high royalties.
>   
>   
>   
>     Hundreds of thousands of books, movies and songs were close to being released into the public domain when Congress extended the copyright by 20 years in 1998.&#8221;
