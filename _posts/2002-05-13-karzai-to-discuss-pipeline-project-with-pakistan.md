Cheney gets his pipeline!


>   &#8220;Afghan interim ruler Hamid Karzai will hold talks with his Pakistani and Turkmenistan counterparts later this month about plans for a pipeline through his country to export Turkmenistan&#8217;s rich oil and gas reserves to the Indian sub-continent , an Afghan minister said on Sunday&#8230;. Building of the 850 kms pipeline, described by many as the new "Great Game" of the new millennium, was a serious competition issue between the American oil company UNOCAL Corp and Bridas of Argentine during the five years&#8217; rule of the Taliban regime, which the United States toppled from power as part of its war on terrorism.&#8221;
