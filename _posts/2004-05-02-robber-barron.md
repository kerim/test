I enjoyed this post from <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/04/mephistopheles_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/04/mephistopheles_.html', 'John & Belle Have a Blog']);" >John & Belle Have a Blog</a>:

> I see that one W. Folsom has written a book entitled *<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0963020315/103-9488332-0417417?v=glance" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0963020315/103-9488332-0417417?v=glance', 'The Myth of the Robber Barons']);" >The Myth of the Robber Barons</a>* &#8230; Well, as a direct descendant of the most bastardly of all the robber barons, Jay Gould, I&#8217;m not taking this lying down. I&#8217;ll have you know that he fully deserved his monicker &#8220;The Mephistopheles of Wall Street&#8221;, not to mention the evocative nickname &#8220;Robber of Widows and Children.&#8221;
