Joba is a new exercise machine from Panasonic. It is a home version of those <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mechanical+bull&#038;page=5" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mechanical+bull&page=5', 'mechanical bull']);" >mechanical bull</a> rides you find in bars out West (at least <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081696/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081696/', 'according to the movies']);" >according to the movies</a>, I&#8217;ve never actually been in such a bar). It is being targeted at women here in Taiwan:
