In the early days, my blog was actually an e-mail list sent out to a group of friends and family members. Then I figured out how to post everything on the web, but I kept the old e-mail list via a service called <a href="http://bloglet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bloglet.com/', 'Bloglet']);" >Bloglet</a>. Unfortunately, that service never worked reliably, and I still get occasional emails from people asking why they don&#8217;t get updates from me in their inbox anymore. I usually refer them to <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20050505.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20050505.html', 'this article']);" >this article</a>, and encourage them to use <a href="http://www.Bloglines.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.Bloglines.com', 'Bloglines.com']);" >Bloglines.com</a>, but I know RSS isn&#8217;t for everyone. So I was happy today to come across <a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/', 'RSSfwd']);" >RSSfwd</a>, a site that send people e-mails whenever an RSS feed is updated.

I&#8217;ve added a &#8220;<a href="http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FKeywords" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rails.yanime.org/rssfwd/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2FKeywords', 'subscribe by E-mail']);" >subscribe by E-mail</a>&#8221; link to my sidebar. Unlike Bloglines you will be updated *every time* I write a new post, not just once a day (I contacted the developer about this, and he said he&#8217;d look into it), but if you really like using your mailbox instead of your web browser or feed reader, then this is for you!

When you go to the subscription link it will show you a preview of the feed. You have to *scroll* all the way to the bottom of the page to find the form where you can enter your e-mail address.

If you use this service, please e-mail me and let me know how it works for you. And consider donating some money to the RSSfwd developer to encourage further development and support.

UPDATE: Oh, and if you still occasionally get emails from Bloglet.com, see the bottom of the e-mail for a link to unsubscribe!
