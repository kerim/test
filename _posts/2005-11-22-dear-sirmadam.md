I got this SPAM/virus/phishing scam e-mail which said:

> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> we have logged your IP-address on more than 30 illegal Websites.
> 
> Important:  
> Please answer our questions!  
> The list of questions are attached.
> 
> Yours faithfully,  
> Steven Allison 

If only the FBI would use &#8220;Sir/Madam&#8221; &#8230; and then sign their messages &#8220;Yours faithfully&#8221;!
