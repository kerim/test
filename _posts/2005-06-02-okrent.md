So long Daniel Okrent. I can&#8217;t say I care. I never learned anything from his pieces, and I can&#8217;t say he did much to affect editorial decisions at the *Times*. His job seems to have been one of damage control &#8211; making the *Times* seem responsive, without really forcing it to respond to anything. But I am surprised that he chose to lash out at Paul Krugman with his parting shot. Mark Schmitt has done a pretty good job of <a href="http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/06/dont_believe_ev.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2005/06/dont_believe_ev.html', 'summing up the spat']);" >summing up the spat</a> between Okrent and Krguman:

> This is mostly pretty arcane stuff, with Okrent accusing Krugman of manipulating numbers of discouraged unemployed workers because he failed to adjust them based on a 1995 research paper, etc. Trust me, Krugman wins every point.
> 
> As to why he didn&#8217;t raise any of these issues with Krugman before, Okrent says that he dealt with him on another issue, and basically Krugman was such a pain in the ass that &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t worth it.&#8221; What a bizarre admission: The whole job of the ombudsman or public editor or whatever the Times wants to call it is to be independent and invulnerable. He&#8217;s got a one-year contract that can&#8217;t be renewed; no editor or columnist can touch him. If he thinks a columnist is misusing data, his job is to say so.

According to Schmitt, it seems that Okrent was duped into being a shill for National Review Online blogger Donald Luskin. As a responsible journalist Okrent should have sought a second opinion on Luskin&#8217;s criticisms before going to press with them and then being forced to retract/reword his criticism.
