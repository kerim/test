>   &#8220;Years ago, it was a different Kabul University, a more relaxed campus where men and women studied in modern facilities. During the opening decades of the Cold War, as the superpowers tried to influence Afghanistan, U.S. aid money flowed to the campus.

Fayez is trying to negotiate similar accords with other foreign universities.&#8221;
