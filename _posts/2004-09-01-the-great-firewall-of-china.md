> while Google is accessible to Chinese users, not all of its functions are available; because of China&#8217;s content filtering technologies, users of Google within China experience a much different Google than those outside. As our tests below indicate, <a href="http://www.opennetinitiative.net/bulletins/006/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.opennetinitiative.net/bulletins/006/', 'China blocks access to the Google cache and to searches that contain certain keywords']);" >China blocks access to the Google cache and to searches that contain certain keywords</a>

Here is a <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/chinadn/en/archives/002885.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/chinadn/en/archives/002885.html', 'breakdown']);" >breakdown</a> of what the Chinese filter:

> About 15% of the words are sex related, the rest are all related to politics. About 20% of the words are Falungong related, including “师父”(master) and “弟子” (disciple); about 15% are names of current officials and their relatives; about 10% are words used in the liberal political discourse such as &#8220;democracy&#8221;, &#8220;freedom&#8221;, and &#8220;dictatorship&#8221;; and about 5% are related to certain nationalistic issues, such as“保钓”(defend Diaoyu Island),“中俄边界” (Sino-Russian Border) ,“卖国”(selling out the country) etc. About 15% of the forbidden words are related to anti-corruption, such as ，“走私”（smuggling） ,“公款”（public funds） etc. Other censored words include names of dissidents, writers, and intellectuals, and names of certain foreign publications.
