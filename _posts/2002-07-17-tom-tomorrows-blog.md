I&#8217;m slowly building up a <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/bookmarks/view_group.php?id=62', 'list']);" >list</a> of interesting blogs. Today&#8217;s latest addition is Tom Tomorrow&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com/', 'webpage']);" >webpage</a> which contains his blog as well. Be sure to check the &#8220;grab bag&#8221; for some of his interesting collections of stuff.
