> &#8220;We will stay the course. We will help this young Iraqi democracy succeed,&#8221; he said in Salt Lake City in August.

> &#8220;We will win in Iraq so long as we stay the course,&#8221; he said in Milwaukee in July.

> &#8220;I saw people wondering whether the United States would have the nerve to stay the course and help them succeed,&#8221; he said after returning from Baghdad in June.
