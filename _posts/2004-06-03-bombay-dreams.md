I rarely (never) go to see Broadway musicals, so perhaps I am not the best person to be criticizing them, but a friend got us free tickets to *Bombay Dreams* so we went. It was beyond awful. Manish Vij <a href="http://www.vij.com/archive/the_bombay_dreams_reviews_train_wreck.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vij.com/archive/the_bombay_dreams_reviews_train_wreck.html', 'summarizes the reviews']);" >summarizes the reviews</a> of this train wreck on his blog. Manish actually liked this musical &#8211; to each his own, I suppose. Personally I was ready to crawl out of my seat during a musical number entitled &#8220;Love&#8217;s Never Easy.&#8221; Eeeeech!

But what really upset me is that there was a complete and total disregard for the Bollywood movie genre which the musical is supposed to be a tribute to. With one notable exception (involving a wet-sari dance number) the songs were worse than your typical Andrew Lloyd Weber drivel (best parodied in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098436/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098436/', 'The Tall Guy']);" >The Tall Guy</a>, where Jeff Goldbloom sings in a musical version of *The Elephant Man*). A big hit in Lodon, the show was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/theater/reviews/30BOMB.html?ei=5007&#038;en=b7823b88720204d3&#038;ex=1398657600&#038;partner=USERLAND&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/theater/reviews/30BOMB.html?ei=5007&en=b7823b88720204d3&ex=1398657600&partner=USERLAND&pagewanted=print&position=', 're-written for American audiences']);" >re-written for American audiences</a>:

> In bringing &#8220;Bombay Dreams&#8221; to the States, its creators have retooled it in the hopes of making it more accessible to Bollywood virgins. Meera Syal&#8217;s original script, which follows a young man&#8217;s speedy rise from the lower depths to the height of movie stardom, has had its plot streamlined and its one-liners plumped up via the three-time Tony-winning writer Thomas Meehan (&#8220;Annie,&#8221; &#8220;The Producers,&#8221; &#8220;Hairspray&#8221;). Much of an involved criminal subplot, with attendant acts of stylized violence, has been jettisoned.

Thomas Meehan? There are so many talented South Asian writers in New York, couldn&#8217;t they at least have found someone who has watched a Hindi movie? Even worse, and I don&#8217;t know if this was in Meera Syal&#8217;s original script or not, the musical depends upon the premise that the main character&#8217;s impoverished lower-caste background is a barrier to a career in the movies. Quite to the contrary, several big Bollywood stars flaunt such backgrounds whenever they can. It sounds to me like a story that would make more sense in class conscious England than it would in India. As the *New York Times* says:

> For a Broadway show set in Bombay that has arrived by way of London, this musical winds up suggesting another provenance altogether: Las Vegas, land of the flashy floor show and simulacra of foreign metropolises, where live entertainment exists mostly as lavish background noise.
