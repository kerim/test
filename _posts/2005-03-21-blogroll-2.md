I&#8217;ve redone my blogroll, which was getting helplessly long. Actually, it was so long that it wasn&#8217;t all showing on the site. Because it seems that I discover new and interesting blogs nearly every day, I&#8217;ve changed my blogroll to be more meaningful. Now I have two sections: &#8220;Favorite Blogs&#8221; with those blogs I actually read regularly. And &#8220;Newly Added Blogs&#8221; showing the last 20 blogs added to my blogroll, with a link to <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/blogroll" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/blogroll', 'the full list']);" >the full list</a> on del.icio.us.

It isn&#8217;t perfect. Some blogs I like probably got cut from the list unintentionally, but I think it will make my list more useful. Sorry if your blog got cut!!! It just reflects my daily reading habits, not the quality of the blogs. For instance, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://talkingpointsmemo.com/', 'Talking Points Memo']);" >Talking Points Memo</a> and <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/', 'Eschaton']);" >Eschaton</a>, two of the finest blogs on the web, got cut because I rarely have the the time to keep up with them.
