Many people seemed happy about the new format, while some still wanted e-mail. Hopefully this compromise will work &#8211; you will get e-mails, but not the whole articles. You will have to click on the links to read the whole article. Also, everyone is now set to get a daily digest, rather than many e-mails. 

There are some cool features that I&#8217;ve added, like the ability of people to add comments, or read the weblog with any RSS enabled newsreader, but I will explain those later, once I&#8217;m sure everything is working.

For those who want to check out the web page,

here is the new URL: <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/']);" >http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/</a>.

I also changed the name of the mailing list, you should see the updated information in the title and footer.

I hope this all works!
