I&#8217;m really just showing off that I&#8217;ve finally <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000818.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000818.php', 'implemented Unicode posting']);" >implemented Unicode posting</a> on my site, but I also wanted to add a footnote of sorts to my <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000566.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000566.html', 'last post']);" >last post</a> about language and gender.

There is a very particular form of female speech in Taiwan, which while it may not be unique to Taiwan, doesn&#8217;t seem to have an equivalent term in English. That term is *sajiao* 撒嬌 (*Sājiāo*). There is a good discussion of it in <a href="http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/chan9/articles/naccl9.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/chan9/articles/naccl9.htm', 'this essay']);" >this essay</a> by Marjorie Chan. Here is how she says the *Modern Chinese Dictionary* defines it:

> To deliberately act like a spoiled child in front of someone because of the awareness of the other person&#8217;s affection.

That&#8217;s about the best definition I&#8217;ve ever seen, although I think you have to watch Chinese Soap Operas to really grasp its essence. I think the effect is best described as &#8220;cute and annoying at the same time.&#8221;
