Schooling is a <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html', 'human right']);" >human right</a>, and Afghanistan&#8217;s girls are being deprived of it by a systematic campaign waged by &#8220;gunmen and warlords who were propelled into power by the United States and its coalition partners after the Taliban fell in 2001&#8243; according to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/07/afghan072903.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/07/afghan072903.htm', 'Human Rights Watch']);" >Human Rights Watch</a>.

The atmosphere of violence, along with resurgent religious fundamentalism in parts of the country, is endangering the most important human rights improvement since the end of the Taliban&#8211;the ability of girls to go back to school.

Bush may have distracted everyone from the failure to find Bin Laden by going to war in Iraq, but now it is time to make him live up to his promises to the Afghan people! In the 70s Afghan women were making great strides. It is only because the US and Pakistan found it useful to support the most repressive elements in society (in order to fight the Russians) that things have become like this. Now it is our responsibility to help make things better!
