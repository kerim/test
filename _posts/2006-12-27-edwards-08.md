Since it has now been officially announced, I&#8217;d like to throw in <a href="http://johnedwards.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://johnedwards.com', 'my endorsement']);" >my endorsement</a>:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kerim/336164856/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/kerim/336164856/', '']);"  title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/138/336164856_4a61008b49_o.png" width="242" height="82" alt="Edwards 08" /></a>

Over the next two years I&#8217;ll be writing an ongoing series of posts about why Edwards is the best man for the job, but the main reason is quite simple &#8230; He isn&#8217;t afraid to speak out about poverty and inequality. Even more importantly, he is able to speak about these issues without being thought of as a &#8220;fringe&#8221; candidate.
