247,966 Taiwanese have married <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/08/205120" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/08/205120', 'foreign brides']);" >foreign brides</a>. Two thirds of these brides are from Mainland China, but what is more interesting is that &#8220;the highest level of eduction obtained by about 40 percent of the foreign wives, either Chinese or other foreign nationals, was junior-high-school level or below compared to 29 percent among Taiwanese wives&#8230;&#8221; No wonder so many of the educated Taiwanese women I know all seem to be a little depressed!
