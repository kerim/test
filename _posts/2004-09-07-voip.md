With <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/05/skype/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/05/skype/', 'Skype&#8217;s']);" >Skype&#8217;s</a> SkypeOut service, internet telephony has truly arrived, but this brings with it a whole set of questions. Most importantly, will <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:voip" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=define:voip', 'VoIP']);" >VoIP</a> be regulated? Aswath Rao thinks it will have to be, and he even <a href="http://www.mocaedu.com/mt/archives/000054.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mocaedu.com/mt/archives/000054.html', 'submitted his views to the FCC']);" >submitted his views to the FCC</a>:

> There is one aspect that did not come up in the Forum that I would like to bring to your attention. What is the nature of a call between a VoIP user and a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:PSTN" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=define:PSTN', 'PSTN']);" >PSTN</a> user? If, for the sake of argument it is decided that VoIP is an Information service, is the interworking call a telecommunications service or an information service? The reason this is important is the phone user has certain rights. Will they be preserved now? Should a VoIP provider facilitate Malicious Call Tracking? Can they? What happens to Do Not Call registry? Will it be preserved?

Now, I&#8217;ve already encountered this issue. I tried using Skype to contact a landline phone that had CallerID blocking (thus blocking all calls without a valid CallerID), since I wasn&#8217;t calling from a phone, it wouldn&#8217;t let me through! Without some kind of regulation this will actually hurt VoIP. Even though I&#8217;m on the national <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx', 'Do Not Call']);" >Do Not Call</a> registry, I am once again receiving telemarketing calls, and I&#8217;m pretty sure they are VoIP calls from India.

But the real question isn&#8217;t whether these things *should* be regulated &#8211; its whether they *can* be? It seems to me that with VoIP running on decentralized P2P networks it will be really hard to regulate or control, although I&#8217;m sure they will try their best.
