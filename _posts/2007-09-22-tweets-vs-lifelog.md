As of now I will stop posting tweets to this blog. Once again this blog will become a space reserved for long-form blogging. You can continue to read my tweets in the sidebar on the right, or over at <a href="http://twitter.com/kerim" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/kerim', 'my Twitter page']);" >my Twitter page</a>.

At the same time, I&#8217;ve stopped using Twitter as a feed aggregator to create a lifelog of all my various feeds, including shared Google reader items, flickr photos, del.icio.us links, etc. All that is now being handled by <a href="http://www.soup.io/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.soup.io/', 'Soup.io']);" >Soup.io</a>, and can be viewed at <a href="http://lifelog.oxus.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lifelog.oxus.net', 'lifelog.oxus.net']);" >lifelog.oxus.net</a>. I like that Soup lets me map this to my own domain, so I can switch to a different lifelogging service at some point in the future if I want to.
