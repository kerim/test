> In Antwerp, Jews and Indians are so embedded in each other&#8217;s lives that many of the Indian dealers speak Hebrew and Yiddish. It is common to see donation boxes for Jewish charities in the entrances of Indian businesses, and after a devastating earthquake in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2001, Jewish diamond traders raised thousands of euros for humanitarian aid. Jewish dealers know how to fix a good cup of chai, the sweet, milky tea drunk by the gallon by Indian traders. Most traditional Indian weddings have a special kosher section, and Mr. Mehta says he has lost count of the number of times he has been lifted up on a chair at a Hasidic wedding. A few years ago, there was even a marriage between an Indian girl and a Jewish boy &#8212; though such close ties are rare. &#8220;We are not a very free society and they are not a very free society, so we have a lot in common,&#8221; Mr. Mehta says.

Here&#8217;s how they close a deal:

> Bharat Shah inspects a small pile of rough gems. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need a magnifying glass,&#8221; he brags, running his manicured fingers across what look like pebbles of glistening sand. &#8220;I can feel the quality.&#8221; After haggling with a Hasidic broker, he writes a check and hands him a sealed envelope. &#8220;Mazel,&#8221; Mr. Shah says &#8212; the Hebrew word for &#8220;luck.&#8221; The expression is as good as a legal contract in the Antwerp diamond world &#8212; both Jewish and Indian &#8212; and signals that the agreed price is final and can&#8217;t be altered.

I&#8217;m not surprised. <a href="http://blog.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.shashwati.com/', 'Shashwati']);" >Shashwati</a> seems to know more Yiddish than I do.
