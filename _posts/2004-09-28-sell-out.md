As much as I love Billmon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.billmon.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.billmon.org', 'web site']);" >web site</a>, I wasn&#8217;t going to comment on his <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-billmon26sep26,1,7245002.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-billmon26sep26,1,7245002.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary', 'silly op-ed']);" >silly op-ed</a> about how the good-old-days of blogging are behind us. Of course they aren&#8217;t. If anything there seem to be more new and exciting new blogs starting up every day then ever before. Sure, the media will co-opt a few bloggers, but so what? Then they become the mainstream and a few hundred new alternative blogs pop up in their place. Nor do I notice much of a difference in quality since any of the big-time lefty political bloggers gave up their day jobs. They all seem to be doing a great job after all these years (OK, after two years).

The reason I decided to write something was because I remember what it was like when I first started blogging. It was hard work. I had to spend hours to find a few snippets of quality information that was critical of the mainstream press. Sure, there were always the British papers, and that is what I started with. But now there are hundreds, if not thousands, of web sites all picking up on important stories ignored on the evening news. Its gotten so much better that I feel free to spend much more time blogging about other things besides U.S. politics and the War. Moreover, more people are reading blogs on a regular basis, so I can simply direct people to a <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/favorites" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/favorites', 'few good sites']);" >few good sites</a> and be done with it, I don&#8217;t have to link to every single story I think is important.

I&#8217;m much more concerned about the issues raised by <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/09/27#a356" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/09/27#a356', 'Ethan Zukerman']);" >Ethan Zukerman</a> who worries about the bias to articles about America and information technology on wikipedia and in the blogsphere. But even here, thanks in part to sites like Ethan&#8217;s <a href="http://allafrica.com/afdb/blogs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://allafrica.com/afdb/blogs/', 'BlogAfrica']);" >BlogAfrica</a>, the situation is so much better than it used to be. I&#8217;m hopeful about the future of this medium, even if the future of the world looks a mess.
