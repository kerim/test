This is amazingly a quote by Dick Cheney (from 1991) on why it didn&#8217;t make sense to seek regime change!  



>   &#8220;You deploy a force, you win the war, and the problem goes away, and it doesn&#8217;t work that way in the Middle East; it never has and isn&#8217;t likely to in my lifetime&#8221;
