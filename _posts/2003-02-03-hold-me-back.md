There seem to be <a href="http://www.nowarblog.org/archives/000698.html#000698" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nowarblog.org/archives/000698.html#000698', 'some people']);" >some people</a> who would like the anti-war movement to focus its energies entirely on the issue of war. The reasoning is that this will ensure a larger coalition of supporters from a broad range of ideological backgrounds whose share only their opposition to a foolish and dangerous foreign policy agenda. To a certain extent I agree with this line of reasoning. However, I also think it is important to keep up pressure on the Bush administration&#8217;s domestic policy agenda as well.

It isn&#8217;t necessary to be a conspiracy theorist to see that there is a certain amount of wagging the dog going on right now. Bush&#8217;s <a href="http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1008" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxusnet.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=1008', 'State of the Union speech']);" >State of the Union speech</a> cynically used national security issues to distract the American public from its disastrous economic policies. (Just read the last two year&#8217;s worth of <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pkarchive.org/', 'Krugman&#8217;s column']);" >Krugman&#8217;s column</a>.) 

As with a schoolyard bully who shouts &#8220;Hold me back!&#8221; before punching another kid, the entire world is divided up between those holding Bush&#8217;s arms (the UN) and those egging him on (Tony Blair). But we must ask, why does the bully shout &#8220;Hold me back!&#8221; in the first place? Not because he doesn&#8217;t want to beat up the target of his wrath, but because he gains so much more by creating such a scene.

I don&#8217;t like to see the domestic agenda reduced to conspiracy theories, but I do think it is important not to forget about tax-cuts for the rich, ENRON, oil-drilling in Alaska, etc. when we protest the war. Otherwise we are given Bush what he wants &#8211; power to define the agenda.
