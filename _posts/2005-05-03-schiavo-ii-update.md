Last week I discussed a <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/04/30/schiavo-ii/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/04/30/schiavo-ii/', '13 year old Florida girl']);" >13 year old Florida girl</a> who was being prevented by the state (her legal guardian) from having an abortion. Today a court ruled that the state <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4510847.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4510847.stm', 'could not prevent her from having an abortion']);" >could not prevent her from having an abortion</a> because Florida state law explicitly states that minors are not required to seek parental consent. I&#8217;m glad the state won&#8217;t force the girl to have a baby she doesn&#8217;t want. I&#8217;m also glad she isn&#8217;t being turned into a political football, as I had feared.

> Florida Governor Jeb Bush said the state would not fight the judge&#8217;s decision, but expressed sadness about the situation.

I guess that whole Schiavo thing didn&#8217;t do so well in the polls.<!-- technorati tags start -->
