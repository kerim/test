I never liked team sports, I never liked playing the dozens, I never liked being put on the spot &#8230; Its not that I&#8217;m introverted &#8211; I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m just not &#8220;quick-witted&#8221; (or at least not as quick as I&#8217;d like to be). Some people love talking on the phone, love chat rooms, love instant messaging, etc. but others prefer their communication out of sync. For them there is e-mail, blogging, forums, and now &#8230; <a href="http://twitter.com/kerim" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twitter.com/kerim', 'Twitter']);" >Twitter</a>.

Asynchronous communication allows you to check in and check out on your own time. The conversation is a <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/03/web_20_is_over_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/03/web_20_is_over_.html', 'stream']);" >stream</a> into which you can choose to dip your toes or go for a swim, or just gaze upon from a distance, depending on your mood.

Some people feel <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/httpwww37signal.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/httpwww37signal.html', 'overwhelmed']);" >overwhelmed</a> by the <a href="http://twittervision.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://twittervision.com/', 'river of information']);" >river of information</a> flowing by. They feel the need to respond to everything, or shut it off completely. This is because they haven&#8217;t yet learned that you don&#8217;t need to read everything, respond to everything, cognitively process everything that is said or written. For them Twitter is simply a distraction.

Perhaps. But perhaps Twitter is actually less distracting than a phone call, IM, or even an e-mail which demands a response. You don&#8217;t need to respond to a Tweet. Not if you don&#8217;t want to.

Or at least I don&#8217;t think you do. I just downloaded <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific', 'Twitterific']);" >Twitterific</a> and started using it today. I&#8217;m not yet sure how I&#8217;ll use it. It might be an alternative to chat, or simply a way of keeping track of how I spend my time. Perhaps I will end up <a href="http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=twitter-tools" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=twitter-tools', 'integrating it']);" >integrating it</a> into my website in some way &#8230; In any case, I like the idea and I&#8217;m going to play with it for a while. So far, the only person I know who Tweets is <a href="http://ilyagram.org/blog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ilyagram.org/blog', 'Ilya']);" >Ilya</a>. If you read this blog and have a Twitter account, let me know.
