>     &#8230;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s problems have been decades in the making. In the early 1980s, the nation&#8217;s per capita income was $28,000 in current dollars, on a par with that of the United States. Since then, the U.S. per capita income has grown to $34,100, while Saudi Arabia&#8217;s has slipped to $7,230.
