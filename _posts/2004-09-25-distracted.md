Well, I didn&#8217;t realize how <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004770.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004770.php', 'much of a distraction']);" >much of a distraction</a> it really was:

> When CBS rushed the infamous Killian memo story to air two weeks ago, they bumped a story about the forged Niger documents to make room for it. <a href="http://corrente.blogspot.com/2004_09_19_corrente_archive.html#109608280122968820" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://corrente.blogspot.com/2004_09_19_corrente_archive.html#109608280122968820', 'Via Corrente']);" >Via Corrente</a>, I just learned that CBS has released a statement saying it has now spiked the story entirely because it would be &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/25/politics/campaign/25cbs.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/25/politics/campaign/25cbs.html', 'inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election']);" >inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election</a>&#8220;

Can someone explain to me why it is inappropriate to air a report critical of the president right when people need to decide whether he deserves another term?
