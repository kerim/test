It&#8217;s plausible that skilled interrogation by the FBI, in accordance with American law, could have produced valuable evidence of these terrorists&#8217; guilt, which could have been used in court.

But by torturing some of al-Qaida&#8217;s leaders, we have completely undermined any efforts to do the former and irreversibly committed ourselves to a martial plan of justice. In the long run, this may be counterproductive, and it will show that we have compromised such liberal, democratic ideals like adherence to the rule of law to counter terrorism.
