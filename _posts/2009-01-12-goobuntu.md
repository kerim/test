I&#8217;ve been using Apple computers since 1986. I used to think I would   
never use anything but&#8230; The recent development of both open source   
and cloud computing has changed all that. A lot of the tools I use   
would run on any platform: firefox, songbird, evernote, open office,   
etc. And more and more, Firefox is all I need. 

&nbsp;I recently switched from using Apple&#8217;s Mail application as my main   
e-mail to using Gmail in the web browser. That wasn&#8217;t my plan. I had   
planned on using Gmail as my server and reading e-mail in Mail, but I   
soon discovered that I like using Gmail online better. For one thing,   
I don&#8217;t need to keep another program running, I can just be notified   
of new mail via the Gmail notifier application.

&nbsp;I can even search Gmail directly from the firefox toolbar:

&nbsp;So if Google were to release their own customized version of Ubuntu,   
&#8220;Goobuntu,&#8221; (currently used by nearly half of their workforce), would   
I switch?

&nbsp;Not yet. Currently there are just too many programs in my workflow   
which are Mac only: Sente and Mellel for academic research and   
writing, Things for task management, Wenlin for Chinese, and numerous   
programs I use for web development, graphics, media, etc. Some of   
these could be replaced, but the replacements that exist currently   
would be a step down. For instance, as impressed as I am with Zotero,   
I can&#8217;t stand the user interface. Not to mention the fact that years   
of using a Mac have given me knowledge about how to maintain and run   
my system which I would have to relearn on a Linux system. So I&#8217;ll   
wait for now. But I think in a few years, when almost everything can   
be done on the web, all I&#8217;ll need will be Firefox &#8230; and Goobuntu   
will be just fine.
