According to two historians, the term goes back at least to World War II, when it was used by Marines and Army troops fighting in the Pacific.

>     &#8230;Applied to Hussein, the term is somewhat misleading, since Hussein reportedly was using his hole for concealment rather than sniping, and he surrendered without a fight. In metaphorical terms, he was more like, well, a chicken in a basket. But spider hole is more accurate than foxhole, which Chuck Melson of the Marine Corps History and Museums Division says goes back to the Civil War, and which typically describes a hole dug quickly, not camouflaged and used by soldiers to protect themselves from enemy fire.
