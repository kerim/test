I was going to write about how you can help out victims of Katrina by volunteering your time to enter data into the <a href="http://192.122.183.218/wiki/index.php/PeopleFinderVolunteer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://192.122.183.218/wiki/index.php/PeopleFinderVolunteer', 'People Finder database']);" >People Finder database</a>, but I see that they are down for the moment:

There&#8217;s a team now working on moving the database to a more robust server. In the meantime, it&#8217;s not possible to add entries to the database.

And yes, that is the tag of Ethan Zuckerman, whose written <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=167" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=167', 'more about the project']);" >more about the project</a> on his blog.

This seems like a way that all of us can do something useful!

UPDATE: They are back up. <a href="http://192.122.183.218/wiki/index.php/PeopleFinderVolunteer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://192.122.183.218/wiki/index.php/PeopleFinderVolunteer', 'Go help']);" >Go help</a>!
