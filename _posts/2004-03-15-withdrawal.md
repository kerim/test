A lot of people have asked me if I plan to march this Saturday. The march, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&#38;sub=45" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&sub=45', 'The World Still Says No to War']);" >The World Still Says No to War</a>,&#8221; is being organized by <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unitedforpeace.org/', 'United for Peace and Justice']);" >United for Peace and Justice</a>, the same people who organized the 3-500,000 people anti-war &#8220;<a href="http://www.grassrootsvictories.org/Content.cfm?contentid=299" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.grassrootsvictories.org/Content.cfm?contentid=299', 'focus group']);" >focus group</a>&#8221; that I participated in last year.

After thinking about it for some time, I have decided that I will not be marching. I think the issues now are too complicated to be effectively conveyed by protest politics. True, &#8220;No War&#8221; was an oversimplification of how I felt last year as well. But I did not want war at that time and not for the reasons we were given. &#8220;No War&#8221; was good enough to capture my feelings at that time, as well as those of half-a-million other New Yorkers.

This time, however, <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&#38;sub=31" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&sub=31', 'the organizers slogan']);" >the organizers slogan</a> is not one that I agree with (emphasis added):

> Now is the time for the voices of peace and justice to speak out. On March 20th a clear, strong message must be sent to the Bush Administration: &#8220;**End the Occupation of Iraq! Bring the Troops Home! Now!**&#8220;

I don&#8217;t like the way the occupation is being handled, I don&#8217;t feel that the likes of Chalebi and Halburton should have anything to do with the future of Iraq. But, at the same time, I think that an early withdrawal would have devastating consequences for Iraqi women and minorities. I think the U.S. needs to go on its knees before the U.N. and to ask for their help in getting us out of this mess &#8211; but I think that bringing the troops home now would be to shirk all responsibility for our actions, and would be devastating for Iraq and the region.

After writing an e-mail along these lines to some friends, I was pleasantly surprised to find out (via <a href="http://www.cursor.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cursor.org/', 'Cursor.org']);" >Cursor.org</a>), that Howard Dean said very much the same thing on <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4515556/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4515556/', 'Meet the Press']);" >Meet the Press</a> (emphasis added):

> I actually fear&#8211;and this is an interesting thing for one of the most anti-war candidates to say&#8211;**my greatest fear right now is that President Bush for political reasons will withdraw our troops prematurely from Iraq**, and that Iraq will descend in&#8211;either to civil war or to chaos. There are significant divisions. If you, for election reasons, bring home the troops too early, then you risk the&#8211;either al-Qaeda establishing a beachhead, and we know al-Qaeda is in Iraq now, even though they were not in Iraq before we went in, or you risk the attempt by the Shiite religious majority to enforce a Shiite theocracy, which is what they have in Iran. I think that would be a very serious problem.

Now, I don&#8217;t think that an Iraqi Shiite theocracy would be the same as an Iranian one, nor am I at all clear about how much al-Qaeda is responsible for the attacks against American forces in Iraq, but I do think that there is plenty to worry about. No matter how I look at it, and no matter how much I feel for the young people risking their lives in Iraq, I don&#8217;t think bringing them home now is the answer. Not without a well thought out exit strategy, and not without ensuring a peaceful future for the Iraqi people. We owe them that much.
