A Taiwanese academic argues that scantily clad women have helped save the economy.


>   &#8220;For a country doing its utmost to step onto the world stage, or for a society doing its utmost to reverse a slumping economy, a never-ending sequence of trade shows is very important. No trade show, be it computer, furniture, wedding gown or food shows or even shows for cars, motorcycles, hygiene and bathroom equipment, can afford not to have a line-up of young women decked out in various costumes, working hard to wiggle their breasts, bellies and legs, in order to help sustain the Taiwanese economic miracle by stirring up purchasers.&#8221;
