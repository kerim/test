> Our initial bake sale goal was $100,000, but MoveOn members always surprise us &#8212; we not only brought in $750,000, but we gave out 40,000 flyers on John Kerry and registered thousands of voters. We estimate that over half a million people baked, bought, or sold food. One sale in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, raised more than $1000 in just a couple hours, and one in Washington had so many bakers they split into four satellite sales around the area.

Now they <a href="http://moveonpac.org/release042204.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://moveonpac.org/release042204.html', 'want to raise $50 million']);" >want to raise $50 million</a>. The thing is, if only 1/4 of MoveOn&#8217;s supporters donate $100, they will meet their goal. I&#8217;m betting they&#8217;ll be as surprised as they were with the bake sale. <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/50forthefuture/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.moveonpac.org/50forthefuture/', 'Give now!']);" >Give now!</a>
