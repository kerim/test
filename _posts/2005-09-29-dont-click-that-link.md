If you&#8217;ve tried clicking on any links on any of my sites (my <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/', 'homepage']);" >homepage</a>, my <a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/', 'wiki']);" >wiki</a>, or this blog), you will get a 404 error telling you that the page was not found. That is because I was up late last night migrating my site to its new home at <a href="http://textdrive.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://textdrive.com/', 'TextDrive']);" >TextDrive</a> where I&#8217;ve bought a <a href="http://textdrive.com/vc3/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://textdrive.com/vc3/', 'lifetime account']);" >lifetime account</a>. TextDrive is considered to be the crème de la crème of web hosting providers, and I have been very impressed with it. However, it is certainly not a site for someone just starting off. Compared with my last host, the difference is like Mac OS X vs. running UNIX from the command line. I could navigate my way through the icon menus offered by my former host, but on TextDrive I have to go read the documentation before I do anything, and probably the support forums as well because some of the documentation is out of date or doesn&#8217;t necessarily tell you the most efficient way of doing things.

The long and the short of it is that the rewrite rules used to map links on my site to the pages that they are supposed to work to are all broken. This is explained in <a href="http://kb.textdrive.com/article/using-modrewrite-with-virtual-subdomains" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kb.textdrive.com/article/using-modrewrite-with-virtual-subdomains', 'this knowledgebase article']);" >this knowledgebase article</a>. I tried to implement the suggested solution on my own, but failed since it seems to be over my head. I&#8217;m a little miffed because I wrote a long post to TextDrive before signing up telling them I planned such a move, and these issues were not made clear to me at the time. But, hopefully, their excellent tech support people (who have been *very* responsive) will help me fix the problems soon and everything will be back to normal. Please be patient.

Until then &#8211; just don&#8217;t click on any links!

UPDATE: I seem to have gotten the blogs working on my own. I tried this <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=3347" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=3347', 'elegant solution']);" >elegant solution</a>, but it didn&#8217;t work for me. However, I did figure some things out and got the blog and my homepage working again. Unfortunately, the wiki is still down, and trying to fix it seems to screw everything else up. This <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=1795" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=1795', 'thread']);" >thread</a> might help, but I&#8217;m too tired right now to tell.
