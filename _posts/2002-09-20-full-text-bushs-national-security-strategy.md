>   &#8220;America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies&#8217; plans, using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.&#8221;

First of all, our intellegence networks have proven so faulty and unreliable that I would be very worried about attacking another country based on their evidence. Secondly, if something isn&#8217;t &#8220;fully formed&#8221; how can we know what form it will take? Finally, isn&#8217;t this simply insane? I mean really, really, nuts? (It has already been pointed out by many on the blogsphere just how much this sounds like the Sci-fi film &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; &#8230;)

Below is a section of the speech that actually makes sense to me:


>   &#8220;Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of every person &#8212; in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. &#8220;


Yes, freedom is threatened by war (as well as terror) so by provking war we are not doing anything to help freedom!!!
