He also <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/004046.html#004046" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/004046.html#004046', 'launched a new web site']);" >launched a new web site</a> where he attempts to <a href="http://www.lifeandliberty.gov/subs/u_myths.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lifeandliberty.gov/subs/u_myths.htm', 'debunk the &#8220;myths&#8221; about the Patriot Act']);" >debunk the &#8220;myths&#8221; about the Patriot Act</a>.

>   Moreover, when the Attorney General makes the unsubstantiated claim that the PATRIOT Act would have definitively prevented the 9/11 attacks, he also obscures another key point: the USA PATRIOT Act isn&#8217;t just about terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the New York Times&nbsp;reported, it&#8217;s been used &#8211; over the objections of the State Department &#8211; to seize funds stolen by American con artists and stashed in overseas accounts.
