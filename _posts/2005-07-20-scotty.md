I don&#8217;t quite know what to make of the fact that nearly every <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4701167.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4701167.stm', 'obituary']);" >obituary</a> out there is misquoting James Kirk, who <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/moments02.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.filmsite.org/moments02.html', 'never actually said']);" >never actually said</a> &#8220;Beam me up, Scotty.&#8221; It seems besides the point. What really matters is that Scotty pushed his beloved ship beyond its limits week after week. Even though we knew the ship wouldn&#8217;t fall apart, actor James Doohan made us believe it would. He knew his ship well, and he didn&#8217;t believe she could take it any more. As we watched the actors throw themselves to the left and to the right as the camera shook around, we still held on to our seats, wondering if they would make it. Maybe it was the accent.

Thank&#8217;s Scotty!
