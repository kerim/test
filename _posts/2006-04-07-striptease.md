The TV show <a href="http://lost-tv.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lost-tv.com/', 'Lost']);" >Lost</a> is full of hidden clues, connections, and mysteries that serious fans can comb for clues. But who has the time? Fortunately for those of us who have only limited time to spend thinking about the *real* meaning behind the show, there is a truly impressive <a href="http://lost.cubit.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lost.cubit.net/', 'web site']);" >web site</a> that carefully collects, categorizes, and posts everything you could possible want to know about the show&#8217;s hidden secrets. For instance, in the show&#8217;s many flashbacks there are often surprising connections between the characters. On <a href="http://lost.cubit.net/connections.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lost.cubit.net/connections.php', 'this page']);" >this page</a> you can find a list of all known connections. (**Warning:** contains spoilers.) Like the fact (and I don&#8217;t think this counts as a &#8220;spoiler.&#8221;) that &#8220;Hurley appears on TV when Jin visits the environmental secretaries house.&#8221; There are even maps and translations of the <a href="http://lost.cubit.net/pics/2x14/glyphs.jpg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://lost.cubit.net/pics/2x14/glyphs.jpg', 'Egyptian hieroglyphics']);" >Egyptian hieroglyphics</a> that appeared on the show a few weeks ago.

I&#8217;m rather worried that when the show&#8217;s creators finally tell us how all these clues add up it will be rather disappointing, but I&#8217;m certainly as sucked in as everyone else by the everlasting hope that the *next* episode will let us in on the secret. The show has to be the slowest striptease act in entertainment history!
