Did Bush authorize the Pakistani&#8217;s to airlift Bin Laden out of the country? Well maybe not Bin Laden, but certainly some of his associates seem to have gotten out that way.


>   American intelligence officials and high-ranking military officers said that Pakistanis were indeed flown to safety, in a series of nighttime airlifts that were approved by the Bush Administration. The Americans also said that what was supposed to be a limited evacuation apparently slipped out of control, and, as an unintended consequence, an unknown number of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters managed to join in the exodus. &#8220;Dirt got through the screen,&#8221; a senior intelligence official told me.
