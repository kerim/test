Students at Georgetown are fighting to get a living wage for the lowest paid employees at the university. <a href="http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/GUlivingwage?rk=w1ahw211yc4wW" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/GUlivingwage?rk=w1ahw211yc4wW', 'Sign a petition']);" >Sign a petition</a> in support of the hunger strikers.

> The Georgetown Living Wage Coalition believes that Georgetown has an obligation to its employees and that it must provide them with a wage that is enough to cover the costs of necessities in Washington, DC. Georgetown has one of the highest compensated presidents in the nation &#8212; at nearly six hundred thousand dollars &#8212; yet they refuse to provide sufficiently for the workers who make the campus function.
