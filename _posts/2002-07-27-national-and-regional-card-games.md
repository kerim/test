Card Games from around the world, and how they are played!


>   &#8220;There are a few card games that have spread throughout the world, but almost all countries and regions have their own characteristic card games. Most people learn to play cards from family or friends, not from books or the Internet. Because of this, card games do not readily spread from place to place. A game that is very popular in one region may be completely unknown elsewhere. International games such as Bridge, Poker and Canasta are the exceptions, and even these often develop local variations.&#8221;
