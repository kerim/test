Bloglet was down all week. E-mail subscribers to this list may wish to <a href="http://test.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/', 'look on the web site']);" >look on the web site</a> to see what they missed. It seems to be working again now, but I&#8217;m testing out a <a href="http://tincan.co.uk/phplist" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tincan.co.uk/phplist', 'replacement for bloglet']);" >replacement for bloglet</a>. If it works well I&#8217;ll switch everyone over in a week or so. Stay tuned&#8230;
