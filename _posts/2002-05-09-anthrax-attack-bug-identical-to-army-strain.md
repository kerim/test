>     The DNA sequence of the anthrax sent through the US mail in 2001 has been revealed and confirms suspicions that the bacteria originally came from a US military laboratory. &#8230; New Scientist can reveal that the two reference strains that appear identical to the attack strain most likely originated at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick (USAMRIID), Maryland. &#8230; The new work also shows that substantial genetic differences can emerge in two samples of an anthrax culture separated for only three years. This means the attacker&#8217;s anthrax was not separated from its ancestors at USAMRIID for long and was therefore acquired relatively recently.&#8221;
