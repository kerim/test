>   The first President Bush has told his son that hopes of peace in the Middle East would be ruined if a war with Iraq were not backed by international unity.  
>   
>   
>     &#8230; He also urged the President to resist his tendency to bear grudges, advising his son to bridge the rift between the United States, France and Germany.

>     &#8230;Mr Bush Sr even came close to conceding that opponents of his son&#8217;s case against President Saddam Hussein &#8230; have legitimate cause for concern.
