This is a post for the New Yorkers out there. I&#8217;m sure there are similar services for other cities, and I hope people will write about them in the comments.

Riding the New York City Subway can be like playing the slot machine. Because of constant construction on the <a href="http://www.mta.info/mta/centennial.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mta.info/mta/centennial.htm', '100 year old system']);" >100 year old system</a>, the trains are always being re-routed. You get on the E train, and suddenly find out that it is taking the path of the F train. You take a local 7 and find out it is only making express stops, or that after midnight all service between Queens and Manhattan has been discontinued. I once found myself standing on a 7 platform late at night wondering why the only other passengers were construction workers!

There is a lot that could be done to improve the way the MTA communicates with customers. Right now the best we have is a <a href="http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/subsrvno.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/subsrvno.htm', 'web page with weekly service advisories']);" >web page with weekly service advisories</a>. It would be better if they provided real-time information, since these advisories often bear little relation to the actual service changes. But, till the MTA gets its act together, we can be grateful to <a href="http://www.robotpolishers.com/subway/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.robotpolishers.com/subway/', 'Robot Polishers']);" >Robot Polishers</a> who has managed to turn the weekly service advisories into RSS feeds. You can subscribe to <a href="http://www.robotpolishers.com/subway/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.robotpolishers.com/subway/', 'individual feeds for each train route']);" >individual feeds for each train route</a>.

And for those who prefer e-mail, the <a href="http://www.straphangers.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.straphangers.org/', 'straphangers network']);" >straphangers network</a> offers to send the same information to your e-mail box each week.

And if you are a NYC blogger, make sure your blog is <a href="http://www.nycbloggers.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nycbloggers.com/', 'on the subway map']);" >on the subway map</a>! [
