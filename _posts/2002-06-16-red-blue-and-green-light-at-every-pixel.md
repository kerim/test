>   &#8220;A new kind of image sensor devised by Foveon, an imaging company based in Santa Clara, California, cunningly solves these problems. The X3 sensor, as it is known, is the first such device to capture red, blue and green light at every pixel in the sensor array. It does this by cleverly exploiting silicon&#8217;s ability to absorb light of different colours at different depths. Red light penetrates deepest, whereas green and blue are absorbed nearer the surface.&#8221;
