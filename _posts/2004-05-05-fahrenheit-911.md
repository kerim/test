> Friends,

> I would have hoped by now that I would be able to put my work out to the public without having to experience the profound censorship obstacles I often seem to encounter.
> 
> Yesterday I was told that Disney, the studio that owns Miramax, has officially decided to prohibit our producer, Miramax, from distributing my new film, &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11.&#8221; The reason? According to today&#8217;s (May 5) New York Times, it might &#8220;endanger&#8221; millions of dollars of tax breaks Disney receives from the state of Florida because the film will &#8220;anger&#8221; the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. The story is on page one of the Times and you can read it here (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/national/05DISN.html?ex=1399089600&#38;en=5dd82385da93ce1e&#38;ei=5007&#38;partner=USERLAND" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/national/05DISN.html?ex=1399089600&en=5dd82385da93ce1e&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND', 'Disney Forbidding Distribution of Film That Criticizes Bush']);" >Disney Forbidding Distribution of Film That Criticizes Bush</a>).
> 
> The whole story behind this (and other attempts) to kill our movie will be told in more detail as the days and weeks go on. For nearly a year, this struggle has been a lesson in just how difficult it is in this country to create a piece of art that might upset those in charge (well, OK, sorry &#8212; it WILL upset them&#8230;big time. Did I mention it&#8217;s a comedy?). All I can say is, thank God for Harvey Weinstein and Miramax who have stood by me during the entire production of this movie.
> 
> There is much more to tell, but right now I am in the lab working on the print to take to the Cannes Film Festival next week (we have been chosen as one of the 18 films in competition). I will tell you this: Some people may be afraid of this movie because of what it will show. But there&#8217;s nothing they can do about it now because it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s awesome, and if I have anything to say about it, you&#8217;ll see it this summer &#8212; because, after all, it is a free country.

UPDATE: From MoveOn.org:

> Tell Disney to show us Michael Moore&#8217;s documentary:

> Louis Meisinger  
> Executive Vice President  
> The Walt Disney Company  
> Phone: (818) 560-1000
> 
> If the line is busy, call a Disney store near you. 

UPDATE: Michael Moore <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php', 'responds']);" >responds</a> to <a href="http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/05/lies_and_moore_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marccooper.typepad.com/marccooper/2004/05/lies_and_moore_.html', 'claims']);" >claims</a> that this letter is a publicity stunt (i.e. that he supposedly &#8220;knew&#8221; Disney would never distribute the film.)
