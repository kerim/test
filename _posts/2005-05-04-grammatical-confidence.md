The <a href="http://www.unis.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unis.org/', 'grade school I attended']);" >grade school I attended</a> didn&#8217;t believe in teaching English grammar, so I remained blissfully unaware of all those rules everyone else seems to have had crammed down their throats. It doesn&#8217;t seem to have hurt me one bit, although it did make things difficult in foreign language classes where teachers suddenly expected students to know the difference between a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund#Some_differences_between_gerunds_and_the_present_participle" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund#Some_differences_between_gerunds_and_the_present_participle', 'gerund and a present participle']);" >gerund and a present participle</a>. (I wish that my school had offered descriptive linguistics as an alternative.) It was at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.haverford.edu/', 'college']);" >college</a> that I encountered &#8220;<a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Language_Police" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Language_Police', 'language police']);" >language police</a>&#8221; for the first time. It wasn&#8217;t my professors, but other students &#8211; unfortunate victims of proscriptivism. I still remember being criticized for using <a href="http://www.protrainco.com/info/essays/pronouns.htm#which-that" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.protrainco.com/info/essays/pronouns.htm#which-that', '&#8220;that&#8221; with a nonrestrictive clause']);" >&#8220;that&#8221; with a nonrestrictive clause</a>.

Comforted by my Freshman English professor that the supposed error was a matter of stylistic choice, I continued to ignore the &#8220;that vs. which&#8221; rule. Until I installed Micro$oft Word, that is. From then on I found myself consistently hounded by my word processor for my failure to apply this rule. I began to lose confidence in my own grasp of English grammar and began to conform.

Fortunately, <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002124.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002124.html', 'Arnold Zwicky has restored my grammatical confidence']);" >Arnold Zwicky has restored my grammatical confidence</a>, He quotes H. W. Fowler, who in 1926 wrote: &#8220;it would be idle to pretend that it is the practice either of most or of the best writers.&#8221;

> In any case, *Merriam-Webster&#8217;s Dictionary of English Usage* details the sad history of this &#8220;rule&#8221;, noting wryly that authors who recommend it routinely violate it and that the facts of usage are squarely against it. MWDEU concludes, &#8220;You can use either *which* or *that* to introduce a restrictive clause&#8211;the grounds for your choice should be stylistic&#8221; (as it was for Bellow), and adds, &#8220;Formality does not seem to be much of a consideration in the choice&#8221;, despite what a number of commentators have claimed.

Unfortunately, some, like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ONLANGUAGE.html?ex=1272686400&#038;en=4230f9f788d16fb1&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ONLANGUAGE.html?ex=1272686400&en=4230f9f788d16fb1&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss', 'William Saffire']);" >William Saffire</a>, continue to perpetuate these myths.
