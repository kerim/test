I didn&#8217;t see the concert, but I&#8217;ve been following responses on the blogsphere. Here are some highlights:

    > whether the whole process really needs to involve Robbie Williams. Or whether it wouldn’t benefit from the involvement of a few more Africans.
    African artists that is &#8211; although it seems they&#8217;ve been ghettoized to <a href="http://www.fox23news.com/news/national/story.aspx?content_id=8AC4A0FE-CAFF-4FDF-9BA1-2682B1B37925" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fox23news.com/news/national/story.aspx?content_id=8AC4A0FE-CAFF-4FDF-9BA1-2682B1B37925', 'their own event']);" >their own event</a>.</li>

        > Live Aid was the anti-punk, its ideological blackmail requiring that we give up on aesthetics AND politics. If post-punk had demanded, and for a brief moment, had got, everything &#8211; sonic innovation and/as political insurgency &#8211; then Live Aid convinced us that in a state of emergency such excessive demands would have to be suspended.
      * Tim Burke says that Live8 was <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=50" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=50', 'worse than nothing']);" >worse than nothing</a>:

        > No. It’s not. Not when your concert is designed to create awareness of something that the audience is already screamingly aware of, the poverty of many African societies, without trying to make them aware of what they don’t know: about how aid is dispersed, about the actual processes of globalization, about the specific humanity of specific African societies. Hell, anything beyond, “Africa’s really poor”. That’s the one thing the rest of the world already knows.</ul>
