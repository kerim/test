This is from a blog supposedly coming <a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/', 'right out of Baghdad']);" >right out of Baghdad</a>:


>   yesterday the last 500 prisoners from the Iraq-Iran war were being exchanged. I can&#8217;t believe they are still doing this, for fuck&#8217;s sake that war ended in 1989. every Iraqi family can tell you a hundred heart braking stories about things that happen when you have thought you brother/father/son is dead and he suddenly appears after 10 years.
