The plan to establish a <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/000035.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/000035.html', 'futures market in terrorism']);" >futures market in terrorism</a> may have been quietly scrapped by the defense department, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t still bet on terrorism. As my friend Rom Enke, an options trader, explained to me, buying and selling futures is just a fancy way of betting:


>   Don&#8217;t let the &#8220;futures&#8221; part confuse you. &#8220;Buying&#8221; a future is betting yes, &#8220;selling&#8221; it is betting no. &#8230; The way the futures contract works, is that if an event happens the contract becomes worth $1. If it doesn&#8217;t it becomes worth $0. Someone who is willing to pay fifty cents for it now, thinks there is at least a fifty percent chance it will happen. Someone who is willing to sell it at twenty-five cents thinks there is at least a seventy five percent chance it won&#8217;t happen (3 to 1 against).


And there is a site, <a href="http://www.tradesports.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tradesports.com/', 'Tradesports.com']);" >Tradesports.com</a>, that lets you bet by buying and selling futures on everything from sports events to, yes, terrorism (although they refer to it as &#8220;Security Alert Levels,&#8221; but its functionally equivalent). It seems that many of there customers are actually futures traders. Its probably where DARPA got the idea from in the first place! What I find truly hilarious is that they are are now taking bets on whether or not DARPA head, Admiral Poindexter, will resign by the end of August!

However, considering <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3115135.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3115135.stm', 'this BBC news story']);" >this BBC news story</a>, it isn&#8217;t really much of a bet&#8230; (Note: This story hit the <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001803.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001803.html', 'blog']);" >blog</a>-<a href="http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003867.html#003867" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/archives/003867.html#003867', 'sphere']);" >sphere</a> before I even finished writing this post &#8211; things move fast in cyberspace!)

UPDATE: I asked Rom how Tradesports could possibly be legal, and how it may or may not be different from gambling. Here is his reply:


>   It very definitely is gambling. And it is legal because it doesn&#8217;t technically take place in the United States&#8211;the company, the servers, and the bank accounts are all in Ireland. And gambling and bookmaking are completely legal in Ireland and the UK.

>     The exchange concept is a bit of a twist on the traditional bookmaker, but not essentially different at all. When you go to a bookmaker, in Vegas, the UK, or online, to get odds on a game, they give you slightly different odds for either team. IE, either way the odds are skewed slightly against you. Like if you bet on a coin toss and bet .50 cents on either side they will only give you .45 cents. Well it&#8217;s not that blatantly unfair (like in the casino), because no one knows what the true odds are. Well in the exchange you can &#8220;improve the market&#8221;, you can tighten the spread between each team&#8217;s odds. Like say a Vegas book maker will offer you 3-to-2 on the Niners. Well suppose I want to get better&#8211; I want to get 7-to-4. On the exchange I post my bid. And eventually some comes along and sees that he can get 4-to-7 from me for the Saints, which is better than the 1-to-2 that the casino&#8217;s were offering.

There are professional bookmakers who make two-sided markets in every event, but there are also customers who know which side they want and just put their price out there and wait to get filled. You don&#8217;t know who you trade with. Just like the stock market and the options markets.
