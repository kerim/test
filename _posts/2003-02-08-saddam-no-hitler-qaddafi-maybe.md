A good point by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/07KRIS.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/07KRIS.html', 'Kristof']);" >Kristof</a> in the NY Times:


>   Hawks often compare Saddam to Hitler, suggesting that if we don&#8217;t stand up to him today in Baghdad we&#8217;ll face him tomorrow in the Mediterranean. The same was said of Egypt&#8217;s Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom the West saw as the Hitler of the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s. But as with Nasser the analogy is faulty: Saddam may be as nasty as Hitler, but he is unable to invade his neighbors. His army has degraded even since the days when Iran fought him to a standstill, and he won&#8217;t be a threat to us tomorrow; more likely, he&#8217;ll be dead.

>     A better analogy is Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who used to be denounced as the Hitler of the 1980&#8217;s. Saddam and Colonel Qaddafi are little changed since those days, but back then we reviled Mr. Qaddafi &#8212; while Don Rumsfeld was charming our man in Baghdad.
