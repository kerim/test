>   &#8220;Microsoft has come up with another novel way to make its software compulsory &#8211; an annual subscription licensing system for schools where you have to pay for all of the computers you&#8217;re using, even if you don&#8217;t want them to run the Microsoft software you&#8217;re licensing. This includes Macs, and although the Ts & Cs of the agreement don&#8217;t make it entirely clear what you&#8217;re supposed to do with the Windows upgrades you end up buying for these machines, we bet putting them on eBay isn&#8217;t a recommended option.&#8221;
