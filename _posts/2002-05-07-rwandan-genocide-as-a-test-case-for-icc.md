The Rwandan experience in particular offers a number of rich lessons about the efficacy (or lack thereof) of the juridical approach to the legacies of violence. First, there is the record of the ICTR court in Arusha: a record that a recent authoritative study summed up as &#8220;lamentable.&#8221; Second, there is the experience of Rwanda&#8217;s post-genocide government, in its attempt to prosecute alleged genocide participants in its own national courts&#8211;an effort which ran parallel to the ICTR prosecutions. &#8230; The Rwandans&#8217; experience is of interest, too, because of what it suggests about the phenomenology of genocide itself.
