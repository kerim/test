Thanks to a friend I discovered JustGive.org, which allows you to donate to charities and non-profits online. This is great for us, because we&#8217;ve been very frustrated that there is no way to have people donate money to <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com/', 'the film']);" >the film</a> online except via PayPal, and since PayPal payments go to us, not our fiscal sponsors, they are not tax-deductible. Now that problem is solved!

(Note: There is a $20 minimum.)

If you hadn&#8217;t donated to the film before because writing a check was too much trouble, now there&#8217;s no excuse.

While you are there, you can also jump to the Justgive.org <a href="http://www.justgive.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.justgive.org/', 'homepage']);" >homepage</a> and donate money to **South Asia earthquake relief efforts** at the same time!

I&#8217;m happy to say that we are already one third of the way to meeting our goal, and we have promises of additional funds coming soon. I had my doubts at first, but now I know we can do it. Please help! And even if you can&#8217;t donate, please help **spread the word**: send an e-mail to your friends, post something on your blog, whatever you can do to help get the word out.

Thank you!
