Until it was reversed by a federal judge, a recent court case in Detroit was

> the only terrorist conviction obtained from the Justice Department&#8217;s detention of more than 5,000 foreign nationals in anti-terrorism sweeps since 9/11. **So Ashcroft&#8217;s record is 0 for 5,000**.

(Emphasis added.

NOTE: Ashcroft claims a higher batting average for prosecutions of Americans, although many of these are for pretty minor infractions. The main point here is that the gross violation of human rights undertaken by the unlawful detainment of over 5,000 foreign nationals was completely unwarranted.
