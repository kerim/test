Mariel Zagunis won the <a href="http://www.fencing101.com/content/view/331/2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fencing101.com/content/view/331/2/', 'first gold medal']);" >first gold medal</a> for the United States in modern fencing history!

> In her final match, Zagunis commanded the bout against Xue Tan of China from the beginning, running an 8-2 streak by the first break. Zagunis fenced with tenacity and imagination, scoring for instance with point-in-line at 5-2.
> 
> After the break Tan rallied, changing her game and taking the score back up to 10-6 to the chants of the large contingent from China. But Zagunis was not to be denied and gritted out the next few touches to finally win 15-9.

I&#8217;m sorry I missed it&#8230;
