As a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/arts/03rich.html?ex=1254283200&#38;en=90e435799b47faa7&#38;ei=5090&#38;partner=rssuserland" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/arts/03rich.html?ex=1254283200&en=90e435799b47faa7&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland', 'new DVD']);" >new DVD</a>, &#8220;Faith in the White House,&#8221; portrays Bush as &#8220;God&#8217;s essential and irreplaceable warrior on Earth,&#8221; it is worth asking the question: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?pt=vKO1twmWG2Uvnyi2qoWQfW%3D%3D" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?pt=vKO1twmWG2Uvnyi2qoWQfW%3D%3D', 'Why doesn&#8217;t Bush go to church']);" >Why doesn&#8217;t Bush go to church</a>? In a recent NRO article, Amy Sullivan asks just that:

> The very fact that the president doesn&#8217;t attend church, some leading conservatives insist, is proof of what a good Christian he is. Unlike certain past presidents they could name but won&#8217;t&#8211;ahem, cough, Bill Clinton&#8211;Bush doesn&#8217;t feel the need to prove his religiosity.

> &#8230;Or it could be that Bush&#8217;s faith, while sincere, is not terribly deep. Aikman, who had significant access to Bush confidantes while writing his book, has said that he &#8220;could not get from anybody a sort of credo of what [Bush] believes.&#8221;

However, the folks at MAD magazine were <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/09/bush-vs-jesus.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/09/bush-vs-jesus.html', 'able to succeed']);" >able to succeed</a> where Aikman failed, clearly articulating the differences between Bush and his favorite savior.
