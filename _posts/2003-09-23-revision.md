This is amazing. There have been lots of lists of lies told by the Bush administration, but Sam Smith has actually <a href="http://www.harpers.org/online/revision_thing/revision_thing.php3?pg=2" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.harpers.org/online/revision_thing/revision_thing.php3?pg=2', 'edited together all these lies into a coherent narrative about the war']);" >edited together all these lies into a coherent narrative about the war</a>. (Albeit a completely deceptive and false narrative.) Here is a sample:


>   The United States approached its postwar work with a two-part resolve: a commitment to stay and a commitment to leave. The United States had no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq&#8217;s new government. That choice belonged to the Iraqi people. We have never been a colonial power. We do not leave behind occupying armies. We leave behind constitutions and parliaments. We don&#8217;t take our force and go around the world and try to take other people&#8217;s real estate or other people&#8217;s resources, their oil. We never have and we never will.


I&#8217;m just waiting for someone to update the text and make it all hyper-text with links to the actual quotes &#8230;
