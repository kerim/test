>   &#8220;There are many recent examples of how preventive actions by the U.S. cost lives, squandered money and heightened international antagonisms. The CIA role in replacing the elected regime of Mohammed Mossadegh with that of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1953 is one. Mossadegh was an Iranian nationalist and neutralist in the Cold War, a stance that made him suspect in the eyes of the Eisenhower administration. But by "preventing" his jump to the Soviet side, the United States helped create the conditions for the eventual triumph of Islamic militants in 1979 who remain hostile to us.
