As Atrios says: &#8220;if race shouldn&#8217;t be a factor in admissions why should it be a factor in funding decisions?&#8221; Is Atrios correct that Bush wants to return to &#8216;separate but equal&#8217;?


>   &#8220;President Bush will propose funding increases for Hispanic-serving institutions and historically black colleges and universities in his 2004 budget, the White House said in a statement on Sunday, on the eve of the Martin Luther King Day holiday.&#8221;
