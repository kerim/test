I can&#8217;t help but be excited about John Cleese related news &#8230; and with Wallace and Gromit mixed in, well, lets just say my expectations are probably way too elevated &#8230;

<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/13/2122237" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/13/2122237', 'John Cleese To Write Next Aardman Film']);" >John Cleese To Write Next Aardman Film</a>:

> BBC has news from the Cannes Film Festival. First, the previously announced [Curse of the Were-Rabbit][1] Wallace and Gromit short is due in Autumn, and [a Trailer is available][2]. Second, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4512099.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4512099.stm', 'John Cleese is currently writing a pre-historic comedy for Aardman Entertainment']);" >John Cleese is currently writing a pre-historic comedy for Aardman Entertainment</a>. From the article: &#8216;It will be great comedy adventure about a pre-historic culture clash between two tribes, one comparatively evolved tribe, and one un-evolved tribe&#8230;Some might consider one tribe might be the English, and some might consider that the other to be the French, the Gauls&#8230;Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s the start of the Entente Cordial and it explains why the English Channel is there.&#8217;&#8221;

BTW: That e-mail running around by John Cleese. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/revocation.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/revocation.asp', 'He didn&#8217;t write it']);" >He didn&#8217;t write it</a>.<!-- technorati tags start -->
