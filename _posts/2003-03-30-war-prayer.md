The following is a quote from an anti-war article Mark Twain submitted in 1905 to Harper&#8217;s Bazaar to express his outrage at military intervention in the Philippines. It wasn&#8217;t published until 1916. It was cited today in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/magazine/30THEOCRACY.html?pagewanted=all&position=top" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/magazine/30THEOCRACY.html?pagewanted=all&position=top', 'must-read article']);" >must-read article</a> by Gary Willis in the NY Times Magazine section, about the role of religion in American military history. The full text of Mark Twain&#8217;s original article is <a href="http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/war_prayer__mark_twain.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/war_prayer__mark_twain.htm', 'here']);" >here</a>.

The quote is an ironic war-prayer that attacks those who invoke God to justify American Imperialism:


>   &#8221;O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; . . . help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land. . . . We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love.&#8221;


In case you were wondering why I am quoting this. Take a look at <a />
