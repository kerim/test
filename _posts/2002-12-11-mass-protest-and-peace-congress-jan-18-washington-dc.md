Just in case you forgot. I imagine that by then we will know if there is going to be a war or not &#8211; it may have already started. In any case, mark your calendars! Also, please note that this web site lists hundreds of events all over the world &#8211; you can search by date, location, or type of event! And the NY Times says there is no anti-war movement to speak of!


>   &#8220;Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in the United States, and around the world, on Saturday, October 26 to demonstrate their opposition to a war against Iraq. At least 100,000 people protested in Washington, DC and 80,000 in San Francisco at rallies that many said were the largest they remembered since the Vietnam War. The lead organization behind the rallies, International ANSWER, has called for another mass protest and a peace congress in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 18 and 19, 2003.&#8221;


(Note: Jan 19 is the Congress, Jan. 18 is the actual march.)
