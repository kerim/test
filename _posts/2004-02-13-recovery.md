I&#8217;m doing OK after my operation. I&#8217;m not taking any pain killers, and I even went for a short walk around the block this afternoon. Physical trauma has a tendency to make us regress, and I&#8217;ve been regressing in style by watching DVDs of my favorite childhood hero: <a href="http://www.aetv.com/tv/shows/horatio_hornblower/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.aetv.com/tv/shows/horatio_hornblower/', 'Horatio Hornblower']);" >Horatio Hornblower</a>. (I&#8217;m loyal to Horatio &#8211; I&#8217;m skipping out on the whole &#8220;Master and Commander&#8221; thing &#8211; at least for now.)

I&#8217;ve also been mindlessly surfing the web. Here are some links I thought worth sharing, even though I don&#8217;t have the energy to write anything about them:

  * Play the <a href="http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002077.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002077.php', 'Bush on Meet the Press Drinking Game']);" >Bush on Meet the Press Drinking Game</a>. (A must see video clip from the Daily Show with John Stewart.)

          * President Bush and his top advisers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A20194-2004Feb6?language=printer" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A20194-2004Feb6?language=printer', 'ignored many of the caveats and qualifiers']);" >ignored many of the caveats and qualifiers</a> included in the classified report on Saddam Hussein&#8217;s weapons&#8230; </ul> <div id="themify_builder_content-1505" class="themify_builder_content themify_builder themify_builder_front">
