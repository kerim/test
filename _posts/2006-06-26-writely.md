Do any of my readers have a <a href="http://www.writely.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.writely.com/', 'Writely']);" >Writely</a> account? I very much need an invitation for a project I am working on regarding using online tools for teaching.

For those who don&#8217;t know, Google is rapidly moving in on Micorosft&#8217;s territory. I&#8217;m already quite impressed with <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://spreadsheets.google.com/', 'Google Spreadsheet']);" >Google Spreadsheet</a>, a collaborative online Excel alternative, and they recently bought Writely which is the same for Word. But these tools are only a small part of a larger change in the relationship between personal computing and the web. For instance, there are now even tools that let you <a href="http://eyespot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://eyespot.com/', 'edit videos']);" >edit videos</a> online!

I plan to explore using these tools in my teaching, but right now Writely accounts are invitation only &#8230; so if you have one please let me know.

Thanks! (I&#8217;ll update the post when I&#8217;ve got the invitation.)

UPDATEï¼š That was fast! Thanks Indy!

If any one comes here asking for an invite, I&#8217;ll be much more likely to give it to you if you donate to the <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/challenge.php?id=162" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.donorschoose.org/challenge.php?id=162', 'Savage Minds Bloggers Challenge']);" >Savage Minds Bloggers Challenge</a>!
