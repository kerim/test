Last week Nicholas Kristof wrote another one of his foolish articles about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/opinion/25KRIS.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/opinion/25KRIS.html', ' sweatshops.']);" > sweatshops.</a> I wrote a letter, which they did not publish. Instead, they choose to publish an article by the &#8220;human rights group, Reebok International&#8221; &#8230; If you want to know more about Reebok&#8217;s work, <a href="http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=40&news_id=1974" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=40&news_id=1974', 'read why']);" >read why</a> &#8220;Prominent women
