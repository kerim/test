>   Iraqi largess toward Palestinian immigrants almost always came at the expense of everyday Iraqis. This was especially true under Iraq&#8217;s last ruler, Saddam Hussein, who forced thousands of mostly poor Iraqis to give up their homes to Palestinians. And now, since Baghdad fell to U.S. forces April 9, hundreds of Iraqis who have waited a generation to reclaim homes commandeered by the Baath Party to house Palestinians have begun knocking on their old doors again, some with assault rifles in hand, to evict families with no place else to go.
