I was thinking about writing something on this issue, when I found this quote in <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/04/index.html#000934" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/04/index.html#000934', 'Tapped']);" >Tapped</a>:


>   Compared to its counterparts around the world, the American press tends to be more reluctant to use graphic images of bodily destruction and death that are the inevitable &#8212; and intended &#8212; byproduct of war. &#8220;It&#8217;s seen as in poor taste, uncivil,&#8221; says Hanson, who now teaches journalism at the University of Maryland. But in a culture that&#8217;s becoming increasingly drenched in violence, it seems odd that war imagery is being treated more and more timidly. When a country goes to war, shouldn&#8217;t Americans understand what&#8217;s being done in their name?


It is from a <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/04/11/images/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/04/11/images/index.html', 'Salon']);" >Salon</a> article about how sanitized the US media&#8217;s depiction of war is. But compare this with how bloody the rest of our media culture is! We have no problems watching reality shows like *Trauma* which are full of blood and gore &#8211; but the media just doesn&#8217;t want to seem like it isn&#8217;t supporting the war. Violence is fine in America &#8211; as long as it is to stop us thinking, not trying to make us think.
