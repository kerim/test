> I think that, if we&#8217;re honest, you cannot it, it&#8217;s just common sense in the math, have universal health care, and invest in energy, and make a serious effort to eliminate poverty, to strengthen the middle class, and do some of the work that I think America needs to be leading on around the world, and at the same time, eliminate the deficit. Those things are incompatible. And anybody who claims &#8212; politicians who say &#8216;I&#8217;m going to give you a big tax cut, and give you health care, put more money into education, and oh by the way, we&#8217;re going to balance the budget in the process,&#8217; it&#8217;s just make-believe, it isn&#8217;t the truth.

Might electing Edwards see Krugman appointed as a top economic advisor? I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed&#8230;
