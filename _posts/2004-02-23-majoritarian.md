There has been considerable discussion (see <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001739.shtml#001739" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001739.shtml#001739', 'the comments over at Lessig&#8217;s blog']);" >the comments over at Lessig&#8217;s blog</a>) about whether or not San Francisco&#8217;s mayor was right to go against the law in allowing Same Sex Marriages. I think Ampersand has <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/001283.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amptoons.com/blog/001283.html', 'the definitive take on the issue']);" >the definitive take on the issue</a>:

> The Mayor has argued that two California laws &#8211; the constitutional call for equal protection, and the statute defining marriage &#8211; are contradictory. Since he perceives a contradiction, the Mayor must &#8220;pick and choose which law to enforce&#8221;; it&#8217;s not possible to enforce both laws at once. Under such circumstances, it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable for the Mayor to decide that his duty is to obey the Constitution, first and foremost. (See <a href="http://volokh.com/2004_02_15_volokh_archive.html#107705524603138461" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://volokh.com/2004_02_15_volokh_archive.html#107705524603138461', 'Eugene Volokh']);" >Eugene Volokh</a> for a more developed version of this argument).

He also eloquently defends the Massachusetts Supreme Court &#8220;anti-majoritarian&#8221; decision.
