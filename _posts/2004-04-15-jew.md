> If you use Google to search for &#8220;Judaism,&#8221; &#8220;Jewish&#8221; or &#8220;Jewish people,&#8221; the results are informative and relevant. <a href="http://www.google.com/explanation.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/explanation.html', 'So why is a search for &#8220;Jew&#8221; different?']);" >So why is a search for &#8220;Jew&#8221; different?</a> One reason is that the word &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&#38;hl=en&#38;lr=&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;oe=UTF-8&#38;safe=off&#38;q=jew&#38;btnG=Search" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=jew&btnG=Search', 'Jew']);" >Jew</a>&#8221; is often used in an anti-Semitic context. Jewish organizations are more likely to use the word &#8220;Jewish&#8221; when talking about members of their faith. The word has become somewhat charged linguistically, as noted on websites devoted to Jewish topics such as these:

>         Someone searching for information on Jewish people would be more likely to enter terms like &#8220;Judaism,&#8221; &#8220;Jewish people,&#8221; or &#8220;Jews&#8221; than the single word &#8220;Jew.&#8221; In fact, prior to this incident, the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; only appeared about once in every 10 million search queries. Now it&#8217;s likely that the great majority of searches on Google for &#8220;Jew&#8221; are by people who have heard about this issue and want to see the results for themselves.</blockquote>
