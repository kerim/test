Jonathan Kozol has an important article in the latest issue of *Harpers*. Although the magazine hasn&#8217;t made it available online, you can <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/American-Apartheid-Education1sep05.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/American-Apartheid-Education1sep05.htm', 'read it here']);" >read it here</a>. In it he dispels the notion that the problems which occasioned *Brown v. Board of Education* have gone away:

> Schools that were already deeply segregated twenty-five or thirty years ago are no less segregated now, while thousands of other schools around the country that had been integrated either voluntarily or by the force of law have since been rapidly resegregating.

Urban public schools have nothing *but* minority students:

> In Chicago, by the academic year 2002-2003, 87 percent of public-school enrollment was black or Hispanic; less than 10 percent of children in the schools were white. In Washington, D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white. In St. Louis, 82 percent of the student population were black or Hispanic; in Philadelphia and Cleveland, 79 percent; in Los Angeles, 84 percent, in Detroit, 96 percent; in Baltimore, 89 percent. In New York City, nearly three quarters of the students were black or Hispanic.

And these schools are anything but &#8220;equal&#8221;:

> The present per-pupil spending level in the New York City schools is $11,700, which may be compared with a per-pupil spending level in excess of $22,000 in the well-to-do suburban district of Manhasset, Long Island. The present New York City level is, indeed, almost exactly what Manhasset spent per pupil eighteen years ago, in 1987, when that sum of money bought a great deal more in services and salaries than it can buy today. In dollars adjusted for inflation, New York City has not yet caught up to where its wealthiest suburbs were a quarter-century ago.

Kozol&#8217;s anger seethes throughout the essay, a chapter from his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=1400052440%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/1400052440%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=1400052440%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/1400052440%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002', 'book']);" >book</a>, but Kozol is most scathing when it comes to those people who question the utility of spending more money on education. Those who ask: &#8220;Can you really buy your way to better education for these children?&#8221;

> Some people who ask these questions, although they live in wealthy districts where the schools are funded at high levels, don&#8217;t even send their children to these public schools but choose instead to send them to expensive private day schools. At some of the well-known private prep schools in the New York City area, tuition and associated costs are typically more than $20,000 a year. During their children&#8217;s teenage years, they sometimes send them off to very fine New England schools like Andover or Exeter or Groton, where tuition, boarding, and additional expenses rise to more than $30,000. Often a family has two teenage children in these schools at the same time, so they may be spending more than $60,000 on their children&#8217;s education every year. Yet here I am one night, a guest within their home, and dinner has been served and we are having coffee now; and this entirely likable, and generally sensible, and beautifully refined and thoughtful person looks me in the eyes and asks me whether you can really buy your way to better education for the children of the poor.

It is even more disheartening when you learn what goes on in these schools, where students are disciplined into a form of robotic obedience that couldn&#8217;t be further from the independent thinking fostered at upscale private schools seek:

> Another signal now was given by the teacher, this one not for silence but in order to achieve some other form of class behavior, which I could not quite identify. The students gave exactly the same signal in response. Whatever the function of this signal, it was done as I had seen it done in the South Bronx and would see it done in other schools in months to come. Suddenly, with a seeming surge of restlessness and irritation—with herself, as it appeared, and with her own effective use of all the tricks that she had learned—she turned to me and said, &#8220;I can do this with my dog.&#8221;
