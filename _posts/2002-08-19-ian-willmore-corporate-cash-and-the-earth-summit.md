Here is another opinion piece on Exxon-Mobile. This time about how they spent nearly a million dollars to pressure the Bush administration not to attend or support the Earth Summit. Imagine if they had spent a million dollars on something to actually help people?


>   &#8220;So you&#8217;ve splashed out $830,000, but in return you have an Administration determined to prevent any real progress at the Earth Summit, which given that you are Exxon has got to be a good deal. And provided no-one puts two and two together it&#8217;s all been done without the public ever catching on. Corporate accountability, not.&#8221;
