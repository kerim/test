Did you know that <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/american_author_1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/american_author_1.html', 'a secret government algorithm']);" >a secret government algorithm</a> assigns you a &#8220;risk score&#8221; every time you fly in or out of the country? That have no way of knowing your own score or of challenging it? That this score will stick around on file for 40 years?

> The scores are assigned to people entering and leaving the United States after computers assess their travel records, including where they are from, how they paid for tickets, their motor vehicle records, past one-way travel, seating preference and what kind of meal they ordered. 

Hmmm, I ordered a vegetarian meal, sat in the aisle seat &#8230; no wonder they gave me a difficult time at San Francisco International&#8230; (Although a colleague who was similarly questioned a little more than usual thinks it is because they can&#8217;t distinguish between Taiwan and Thailand, the latter being a known source of drugs.)
