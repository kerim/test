This is <a href="http://funferal.org/mt-archive/000514.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://funferal.org/mt-archive/000514.html', 'an upsetting abuse of copyright laws']);" >an upsetting abuse of copyright laws</a>. On what grounds can anyone justify giving Joyce&#8217;s heirs 70+ more years of copyright to his work?

> James Joyce died in 1941 and the copyright in his work expired in 1991. Then the EU extended terms to life+70 years, and the work went back into copyright in July 1995. The estate has been very active in enforcing their copyright, suing regularly. While some of their actions have been aimed at issues such as protecting the memory of Joyce&#8217;s daughter Lucia from scrutiny, other suits have been against non-commercial uses of the works by fans. As such, they seem solely concerned with the financial health of the estate [admittedly one of their roles] having no concern for nurturing the greater cultural legacy of Joyce.
