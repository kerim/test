Somehow, in all my viewings of *From Russia with Love*, I never noticed that there was <a href="http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/allies/bey.php3?t=frwl&#038;s=frwl" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/allies/bey.php3?t=frwl&s=frwl', 'a character named Kerim']);" >a character named Kerim</a>. Must be because I&#8217;m usually doing something else when I&#8217;m watching a Bond film &#8211; like washing dishes.

By the way, *Keywords* is <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/10/1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2004/09/10/1/', 'still the #1 result']);" >still the #1 result</a> for &#8220;Kerim&#8221; when searching Google, even after Google <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001916.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001916.html', 'changed the way they rank blog posts']);" >changed the way they rank blog posts</a>. Presumably because I have my own hosting.
