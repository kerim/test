This is an expanded version of an article in Yediot Aharonot, June 30, 2002.

The Gaza strip is a perfect realization of the Israeli vision of  
  
&#8220;separation&#8221;. Surrounded with electric fences and army posts,  
  
completely sealed off the outside world, Gaza has become a huge  
  
prison. About one third of its land was confiscated for the 7,000  
  
Israeli settlers living there (and their defense array), while over a  
  
million Palestinians are crowded in the remaining areas of the  
  
prison. With no work or sources of income, about 80% of its residents  
  
depend, for their living, on UNRWA, or contributions from Arab states  
  
and charity organizations. Now Israel is considering the  
  
imprisonment there of families of suicide bombers from the West Bank  
  
(1). As a senior Israeli analyst stated, Gaza can now serve as &#8220;the  
  
penal colony&#8221; of Israel its &#8220;devils island, Alcatraz&#8221;. (Nahum  
  
Barnea, Yediot Aharonot June 21, 2002).

This is the future that Sharon and the Israeli army designate for  
  
the West Bank as well. While the external fence is presently being  
  
built, Israel&#8217;s current military operation is set to be the final  
  
step in the implementation the IDF plans for reestablishing full  
  
military rule (which was abolished in large parts of the West Bank  
  
during the Oslo process). Though Israel describes everything it does  
  
as a spontaneous reaction to terror, the plan was fully spelled out  
  
in the Israeli media already back in March 2001, soon after Sharon  
  
entered office. Alex Fishman, military and strategic analyst of  
  
Yediot Aharonot, explained at the time that since Oslo, &#8220;the IDF  
  
regarded the occupied territories as if they were one territorial  
  
cell&#8221;, and this placed some constraints on the IDF and enabled a  
  
certain amount of freedom for the PA and the Palestinian population.  
  
The new plan is a return to the concept of the military  
  
administration during the preOslo years: the occupied territories  
  
will be divided into tens of isolated &#8220;territorial cells&#8221;, each of  
  
which will be assigned a special military force, &#8220;and the local  
  
commander will have freedom to use his discretion&#8221; as to when and who  
  
to shoot. (Yediot Ahronot weekend supplement, March 9.2001).

The first stage of this plan the destruction of the institutions of  
  
the Palestinian Authority was completed in the previous &#8216;Operation  
  
Defensive Shield&#8217; in April of this year. In practice, from that time  
  
on, the towns and villages of the West Bank have been completely  
  
sealed. Even exit by foot, which was possible up to that point,  
  
became blocked, and movement between the &#8220;territorial cells&#8221; now  
  
requires formal permits from the Israeli military authorities.  
  
Soldiers and snipers prevent any &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; walking to  
  
agricultural fields, to places of work and study, or for medical  
  
treatment.

However, unlike the preOslo period of Israeli military rule, the army  
  
makes it clear that there is no intention to construct any civil  
  
administration that will take care of the basic daily needs of the  
  
two million Palestinians, such as food supplies, health services,  
  
garbage and sewage. For these tasks, some form of a Palestinian  
  
Authority will be maintained, though in practice it will not be  
  
allowed to function.

As a &#8216;military source&#8217; told Ha&#8217;aretz, &#8220;Internal conclusions of the  
  
security echelons, following operation &#8216;Defensive Shield&#8217;, assessed  
  
that the functioning of the civil branches of the Palestinian  
  
Authority had reached an unprecedented nadir, mainly due to the  
  
destruction the IDF operation left behind in Ramallah (including the  
  
systematic destruction of computers and databases)&#8230; Combined with  
  
the severe restrictions on movement, the Palestinian population is  
  
becoming, as the military source defined it, &#8216;poor, dependent,  
  
unemployed, rather hungry, and extreme&#8217;&#8230; The financial reserves of  
  
the Palestinian authority are reaching the bottom&#8230; In a future not  
  
far off, the majority of Palestinians will only be able to maintain a  
  
reasonable life through the help of international aid.&#8221; (Ha&#8217;aretz  
  
Hebrew edition, June 23, 2002, Amos Har&#8217;el). Thus, the West Bank is  
  
being driven to the level of poverty of the Gaza strip.

Nevertheless, at the same time that Israel deprives the Palestinians  
  
of their means of income, it also makes a substantial effort to  
  
diminish or block international aid, under the pretext that the aid  
  
is used to support terrorists or their families. At the outset of its  
  
new &#8216;operation&#8217;, Israel &#8220;decided to stop the flow of foodaid and  
  
medicine from Iran and Iraq to Palestinians in the territories&#8221;  
  
(Ha&#8217;aretz, June 24, 2002, Amos Har&#8217;el). Iranian and Iraqi aid is an  
  
easy target for Israel, as these countries belong to the &#8220;Axis of  
  
Evil&#8221;. However, Israel started launching a more ambitious campaign:  
  
The EU the largest PA donor is under constant pressure from Israel  
  
to cut its aid, which is used, inter alia to pay the salaries of  
  
teachers and health workers. The tactics are always the same: Israel  
  
provides some documents presumably linking the PA to terror. Any aid  
  
to the PA is, therefore, aid to terror (2).

UNRWA&#8217;s aid is the next target. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for  
  
Palestinians in the Near East (UNRWA) has become a major source of  
  
food for Palestinians in the besieged territories. Its food supplies  
  
are now delivered not only to the refugee camps, but also in towns  
  
and villages. The amount of food UNRWA supplies has increased  
  
fourfold in two years (3). Recently, &#8220;Israel has begun a campaign in  
  
the United States and the United Nations to urge a reconsideration of  
  
the way the UN Relief and Works Agency, which runs the Palestinian  
  
refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza, operates. Israel charges  
  
that UNRWA workers simply ignored the fact that Palestinian  
  
organizations were turning the camps into terrorist bases and it is  
  
demanding the agency start reporting all military or terrorist  
  
actions within the camps to the UN&#8230;. Meanwhile, Jewish and  
  
proIsraeli lobbyists in the U.S. are waging a parallel campaign &#8230;  
  
American Jewish lobbyists are basing their efforts on the fact that  
  
the U.S. currently contributes some 30 percent of UNRWA&#8217;s $400  
  
million a year budget, and is therefore in a position to influence  
  
the agency: A congressional refusal to approve UNRWA&#8217;s funding could  
  
seriously disrupt its operations. (Ha&#8217;aretz June 29, 2002, Nathan  
  
Guttman). The campaign is not yet demanding cutting UNRWA&#8217;s aid and  
  
presence altogether, but raising the impossible demand that UNRWA  
  
should serve as an active force in &#8220;the war against terror&#8221;  
  
(&#8220;reporting military or terrorist actions&#8221;) is the first step towards  
  
such a demand.(4)

Since September 11, Sharon has been constructing an analogy between  
  
the occupied territories and Afghanistan (with the PA as Al Qaeda).  
  
He keeps declaring that the solution to Palestinian terror, and the  
  
required &#8216;reforms&#8217;, should be along the lines set in Afghanistan.  
  
The analogy is frighteningly revealing: As it established the  
  
&#8216;reforms&#8217; in Afghanistan, the US forced starvation upon millions of  
  
people. This is how Noam Chomsky described it: &#8220;On Sept. 16, the New  
  
York Times reported that &#8216;Washington has also demanded [from  
  
Pakistan] a cutoff of fuel supplies&#8230;and the elimination of truck  
  
convoys that provide much of the food and other supplies to  
  
Afghanistan&#8217;s civilian population.&#8217; Astonishingly, that report  
  
elicited no detectable reaction in the West, a grim reminder of the  
  
nature of the Western civilization that leaders and elite  
  
commentators claim to uphold. In the following days, those demands  
  
were implemented&#8230; &#8216;The country was on a lifeline,&#8217; one evacuated  
  
aid worker reports, &#8216;and we just cut the line&#8217; (NY times Magazine,  
  
September 30). According to the world&#8217;s leading newspaper, then,  
  
Washington demanded that Pakistan ensures the death of enormous  
  
numbers of Afghans, millions of them already on the brink of  
  
starvation, by cutting off the limited sustenance that was keeping  
  
them alive.&#8221; (Interview with Michael Albert, reprinted in Noam  
  
Chomsky, 911, Seven Stories, 2002). Arundhati Roy, summarized this  
  
at the time: &#8220;Witness the infinite justice of the new century.  
  
Civilians starving to death while they&#8217;re waiting to be killed&#8221;  
  
(Guardian, Sept. 29).

The new stage of Israel&#8217;s &#8216;separation&#8217; can no longer be compared to  
  
the Apartheid of South Africa. As Ronnie Kasrils, South Africa&#8217;s  
  
Minister of Water Affairs, said in an Interview with Al Ahram Weekly,  
  
&#8220;the South African apartheid regime never engaged in the sort of  
  
repression Israel is inflicting on the Palestinians&#8221; (Issue of March  
  
28 April 3, 2002). We are witnessing the daily invisible killing of  
  
the sick and wounded being deprived of medical care, the weak who  
  
cannot survive in the new poverty conditions, and those who are bound  
  
to reach starvation.

Nevertheless, the public debate in Israel revolves around questions  
  
of efficiency: Is it possible to stop terror in such methods. Let us  
  
suppose even that it is. Is it allowed? Is this what we (Israelis)  
  
want to be?

One people stole the &#8216;Lamb of its poor neighbor'(5): Gaza and the  
  
West Bank are 22% of the land of Israel- Palestine, where the  
  
Palestinians lived in the past. On this small piece of land, three  
  
million people live, with hopes, needs and dreams, just like ours.  
  
Since Oslo, they have been lured with promises that we are about to  
  
evacuate the settlements and give them back their land, at the very  
  
same time that we have been imprisoning them in Gaza, stealing more  
  
of their land in the West Bank, and leaving them no hope whatsoever.  
  
The Palestinian people are fighting for their freedom. The crimes of  
  
Palestinian terror do not remove our culpability for our own crimes.

Before Oslo, as well, there was a wave of horrible terror attacks.  
  
But at that time, after each such attack, the call was heard get out  
  
of the territories! Then it was still understood that when you leave  
  
people no hope, there is no way to stop the madness of suicide  
  
bombing. It is not too late to get out of the territories.

========  
  
(1) In its meeting on Friday, June 21, 2002, the Israeli cabinet  
  
&#8220;decided in principle in favor both of the expulsion of families of  
  
suicide strikers from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip&#8230; The  
  
implementation of this expulsion policy depends upon the outcome of a  
  
legal review.&#8221; (&#8216;IDF set to expel bombers&#8217; families&#8217; By Aluf Benn,  
  
Amos Harel and Gideon Alon, Ha&#8217;aretz June 23, 2002).

(2) Here is one example of the pressure on the EU:  
  
&#8220;The documents seized from PA offices in recent months, some  
  
of which were included in the document compiled by minister without  
  
portfolio Dan Naveh following Operation Defensive Shield, were  
  
presented last week to the EC delegation in Israel and  
  
representatives of the International Monetary Fund at a meeting with  
  
IDF intelligence officers. Naveh claims the documents prove European  
  
financial aid has been used to finance terrorism and incitement, and  
  
has also found its way into the pockets of senior PA officials.

The head of the EC&#8217;s delegation to Israel, Giancarlo  
  
Chevallard, told Ha&#8217;aretz that at the meeting, the delegation saw  
  
evidence that Arafat is financing terrorism, but added Israel had not  
  
provided evidence that European financial aid which is designated to  
  
pay the salaries of PA employees is being used to finance terrorist  
  
attacks. Another senior delegation official said he was extremely  
  
skeptical Israel had evidence to prove European aid is being used by  
  
the PA to finance terrorism&#8230;

Meanwhile, in the shadow of the Israeli accusations, the  
  
European Parliament&#8217;s budgetary committee last week delayed the  
  
transfer of 18.7 million euros in financial aid to the PA until the  
  
EC reports how the money is to be distributed&#8230;&#8221; (Ha&#8217;aretz, June 6,  
  
2002, Yair Ettinger)  
  
This specific frozen amount was released in the meanwhile, however  
  
Israel&#8217;s pressure continues.

humanitarian organizations try to replace it&#8217;, Ha&#8217;aretz Hebrew  
  
edition, June 23, 2002. (Quoted before).

(4). The campaign against UNRWA started earlier: &#8220;In letters written  
  
to Annan in May, Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter and Democratic  
  
U.S. Representative Tom Lantos accused the U.N. agency of allowing  
  
and promoting terrorist activity in the camps. Specter said UNRWA  
  
schools promoted antiIsraeli and anti Semitic sentiments and Lantos  
  
said the agency allowed terrorists to organize in the camps.&#8221;(Inter  
  
Press Service, June 24, 2002)

(5) Bible, Samuel II, 12:11: &#8220;12:1The LORD sent Natan to David. He  
  
came to him, and said to him, &#8220;There were two men in one city; the  
  
one rich, and the other poor. 12:2The rich man had very many flocks  
  
and herds, 12:3but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe  
  
lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him,  
  
and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup,  
  
and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter. 12:4A traveler  
  
came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of  
  
his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but  
  
took the poor man&#8217;s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to  
  
him.&#8221; (http://ebible.org/bible/hnv/2Sam.htm)
