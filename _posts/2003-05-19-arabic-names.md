>   Basically, a traditional Arabic name given in full consists of the kunya (&#8216;father/mother of X&#8217;), the ism (the actual given name, e.g. Muhammad or Abdullah), the nasab (&#8216;son/daughter of Y&#8217;), the nisba (an adjective indicating one&#8217;s place of origin, religion, or some other identifier), and one or more laqab s (nicknames to provide further identification), in that order. To use Annemarie Schimmel&#8217;s example, the name Abu&#8217;l-Mahasin Yusuf ibn Abi Yusuf Ya&#8217;qub al-Makki al-Hanbali al-Zayyat means &#8220;Yusuf, father of al-Mahasin, son of Abu Yusuf Ya&#8217;qub [note that Ya&#8217;qub is identified as father of Yusuf], from Mecca, belonging to the Hanbali school of religious jurisprudence, the oilman.&#8221; Unfortunately for the outsider, people can be referred to by any part of this string (except, usually, the ism , since given names are too common to be of much use); if there is a conventional name by which the person is traditionally known, it is called the &#8216;urf (&#8216;custom&#8217;). So our friend Yusuf might be generally known as Abu&#8217;l-Mahasin or al-Zayyat (the other laqab s being too common themselves to identify him).
