When I travelled in mainland China in the late 80s there was a black market in currency, trading government issued currency specially printed for foreigners, which allowed one to purchase speciality items not available in the local markets, for local currency. When I first arrived I was soon instructed in the fine art of recognizing common scams, like the &#8220;recount&#8221; in which a few bills disappeared from the bottom of the pile. Now China&#8217;s markets are much more open and there is no special currency for foreigners. However, there is still a black market &#8230; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/books/review/013MEYERL.html?ei=5090&#038;en=e3fcab63365de272&#038;ex=1268370000&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/books/review/013MEYERL.html?ei=5090&en=e3fcab63365de272&ex=1268370000&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=print&position=', 'in ISBN numbers']);" >in ISBN numbers</a>!

> At the heart of the state press&#8217;s power is its control of the nation&#8217;s market in International Standard Book Numbers, or ISBN&#8217;s, the bar-code-like number that identifies a book for commercial consumption. Without one, a book can&#8217;t be published in China, with the exception of party tracts and state-sanctioned religious texts&#8230;

> But as in so many other sectors of China&#8217;s economy, a parallel, unofficial market in ISBN codes has mushroomed among China&#8217;s estimated 30,000 private publishers. Known as &#8221;culture houses&#8221; or &#8221;booksellers,&#8221; they act like packagers: finding titles, buying rights, and shopping them to state-owned publishers, who will issue an ISBN for a fee ranging from $1,250 to $2,500, then publish the book under the state imprimatur. Agreements can also include the sharing of production costs, marketing and distribution.

> It&#8217;s considered an openly illegal system, tolerated to a point. Officially, the buying and selling of ISBN&#8217;s is forbidden. In a round of recent speeches aimed at culling pornography and other &#8221;illegal publications jeopardizing social stability,&#8221; government officials vowed to crack down on culture houses, calling them &#8221;malignant tumors that must be excised.&#8221;

It will be interesting to see what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#Planned_upgrade" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#Planned_upgrade', 'planned upgrade']);" >planned upgrade</a> to the ISBN number system, or the competing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#EAN_format_used_in_barcodes" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#EAN_format_used_in_barcodes', 'EAN system']);" >EAN system</a> will do to China&#8217;s illegal market in ISBN numbers.
