I&#8217;m off to Philadelphia to present the <a href="http://www.dissertationdoctor.com/advice/orals.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dissertationdoctor.com/advice/orals.html', 'oral defense']);" >oral defense</a> of my dissertation. Wish me luck. I hope I can get some sleep on the train, because I certainly didn&#8217;t get any last night.

UPDATE: The oral defense part went well; however, there are still major revisions to be made on my written document &#8211; and they all have to be completed within 30 days. Looks like I will be very busy for a few weeks! So no congratulations just yet, please &#8211; it just makes me more anxious thinking about how much work I still have to do before I am &#8220;really&#8221; done.
