Even though I didn&#8217;t get any offers for hosting of the No War Wikki, I&#8217;ve got it up and running!!! Right now there is no actual content, but anyone who registers as a user can add content. Please <a href="http://www.nowarwikki.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nowarwikki.org', 'check out the site']);" >check out the site</a>, and help make it work! There is information on the main page about what to do if you can help out as an editor on the site. 

A wikki is a collaborative web site where any user can edit any page. More information about this is located on the site. The idea is to create a database of the &#8220;best of&#8221; all the articles that have been posted to all of the anti-war blogs, newspapers, etc. on the web. Guidelines for content submission are posted on the site. More information about wikkis is is also posted there.

The official URL is <a href="http://www.nowarwikki.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nowarwikki.org', 'nowarwikki.org']);" >nowarwikki.org</a>. Because I am using a cheap hosting solution you will see the URL change after you click on a few links. Please use the official URL when linking to the site, as the other url may change. (If someone offers me a better hosting solution&#8230;)
