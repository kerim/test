Back in September Calpundit used the phrase &#8220;technical lie&#8221; to refer to Bush administration statements which are &#8220;<a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002180.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002180.html', 'carefully constructed to leave an incorrect impression']);" >carefully constructed to leave an incorrect impression</a> &#8212; but that turns out to be technically true if you parse it closely enough.&#8221; Examples he gave then were in reference to <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2085689/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://slate.msn.com/id/2085689/', 'stem cells']);" >stem cells</a>, the famous &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030128-19.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030128-19.html', '16 words']);" >16 words</a>,&#8221; and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030107.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030107.html', 'dividend tax-cuts']);" >dividend tax-cuts</a>. Today he adds a new item to the list: <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002446.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002446.html', 'botulism']);" >botulism</a>.

He quotes <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/10/index.html#001703" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2003/10/index.html#001703', 'Matthew Yglesias']);" >Matthew Yglesias</a>:


>   Long story short: There&#8217;s no threat here. This raises the question of why, exactly, Kay&#8217;s team and the gang at the White House are trying to convince people that there is. Politically speaking, obfuscation is an effective strategy on this subject, since it&#8217;s easy to get confused between the botulinum B bacteria (not dangerous, found in Iraq) and the botulinum A neurotoxin (dangerous, not found in Iraq). I myself made this mistake, but I&#8217;m not a biologist and I&#8217;m certainly not a biowarfare expert. This tactic &#8212; saying things that are true in such a way as to get people to believe things that are false &#8212; has become a prominent feature of the administration&#8217;s public relations strategy on a number of fronts and, frankly, it stinks.
