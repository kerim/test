So I felt better reading about the the travails of <a href="http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&#38;y=archives/002050" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&y=archives/002050', 'Ernie']);" >Ernie</a>, a second generation Chinese American, who accidentally called his &#8220;grandmother&#8217;s brothers daughter&#8221; a &#8220;pan-fried meat dumpling&#8221; when visiting over Christmas.
