This post is for people using Samsung laser printers with Apple Time Capsule (although its possible that other people are having similar issues). I had so much trouble trying to figure out how to fix the problem, which plagued us for months, that I wanted to post this on my scrapbook in the hopes that other people having this problem might have an easier time finding the solution. Although I should warn you that this doesn&#8217;t seem to work for everyone&#8230; 

I eventually found a solution which works for me on Apple&#8217;s support forums. There are so many similar threads its hard to know which one to look at for the answer. I found the answer in <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8995520#8995520" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8995520#8995520', 'this thread']);" >this thread</a>:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
  
    Open AirPort Utility>select the Time Capsule>Manual Setup>Select the &#8220;Printers&#8221; tab at the top>check the box in front of &#8220;Share printers over Ethernet WAN port&#8221;>click update at the bottom and Voila!!

  That&#8217;s it. Hope it helps!



  UPDATE: Hmmm. Immediately after post this, the printer stopped working again&#8230; Should have kept my mouth shut!
