Amardeep Singh has a good profile of the man who looks to be India&#8217;s new PM: <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/05/so-no-sonia-sardar-profile-of-manmohan.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/05/so-no-sonia-sardar-profile-of-manmohan.html', 'Manmohan Singh']);" >Manmohan Singh</a>.

> Manmohan Singh is a Congress-wallah to the core: no one has ever seriously questioned his loyalty to the Congress Party or to India. If anything, one might question his tendency to reduce ideological problems to economic ones.

If I understand correctly, it was Congress under Singh, not the BJP that first began implementing the economic reforms, so this should pacify the plummeting stock markets. But will it pacify the rural farmers who rebelled against the reforms and kicked the BJP out of power?
