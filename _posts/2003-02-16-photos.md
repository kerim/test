>   Hundreds of thousands of people around the world staged antiwar protests in scores of cities


&#8230;. hmmm I&#8217;m pretty sure it was in the millions from what I&#8217;ve read. Hell, even the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/international/16RALL.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/international/16RALL.html', 'NY Times']);" >NY Times</a> admits that there were nearly a million in London alone. But in any case, the NY Times does have some great photos, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2003/02/15/international/15protest.slideshow_1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2003/02/15/international/15protest.slideshow_1.html', 'here']);" >here</a>. (I found the actual URL so you don&#8217;t have to deal with the NY Times Javascript pop-ups that don&#8217;t work if you have pop-up blocking on. And I did the same thing for the annoying BBC pop-ups as well. You can view the BBC slideshow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/world_world_peace_protests/html/1.stm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/world_world_peace_protests/html/1.stm', 'here']);" >here</a>. And the same for the Washington Post photos <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/flash/photo/world/protest2152003/index_frames.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/flash/photo/world/protest2152003/index_frames.htm', 'here']);" >here</a>.
