In the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15136-2003Apr12.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15136-2003Apr12.html', 'Washington Post']);" >Washington Post</a>, the deputy director of the Iraqi Archaeological museum ransacked by looters says:


>   &#8220;If there were five American soldiers at the door, everything would have been fine,&#8221; Amin said about the museum. &#8220;They&#8217;re supposed to be here to protect us. They should be protecting us.&#8221;


Interestingly, the Oil Ministry was very well protected:


>   Some Iraqis, however, question the allocation of U.S. forces around the capital. They note a whole company of Marines, along with at least a half-dozen amphibious assault vehicles, has been assigned to guard the Oil Ministry, while many other ministries &#8212; including trade, information, planning, health and education &#8212; remain unprotected.

>     &#8220;Why just the oil ministry?&#8221; Jaf asked. &#8220;Is it because they just want our oil?&#8221;
>   


And another article from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19691-2003Apr13.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19691-2003Apr13.html', 'Washington Post']);" >Washington Post</a> describes how scholars warned the Pentagon about the risks back in **January**!


>   Scholars first sounded a public alarm about the possible destruction of Iraqi antiquities in January, when a statement from the Archaeological Institute of America called on &#8220;all governments&#8221; to protect cultural sites during an expected conflict and in its aftermath.

>   Now certainly this is not a smoking gun to determine the foreign policy of a whole country &#8212; but it should be very disturbing that this administration has little regard for history, antiquity, and the 1954 Hague Convention.
