Pretty funny actually.

I read this article just the other day, and all I could think about is why does this bastion of &#8220;high culture&#8221; get all giddy over some white pop sensation who denigrates gays and women, when there are hundreds of brilliant black rappers who&#8217;ve been performing work for years that is far superior to many of the novelists and poets that usually grace the pages of this esteemed publication? I&#8217;m not a rap aficionado, but I can tell the difference between <a href="http://www.eminem.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eminem.com', 'Eminem']);" >Eminem</a> and <a href="http://www.theroots.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theroots.com/', 'The Roots']);" >The Roots</a>&#8230; (i.e. between pop music and real creative talent.) Unfortunately the NY Review of Books does not. Or perhaps they do, but they feel that by canonizing a few low-culture icons they can avoid having to actually take popular culture seriously the rest of the time? Who knows &#8230;

Still, it is worth reading the latest issue of the NYR, if only for Garry Wills&#8217; article on <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16740" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16740', 'Jefferson&#8217;s &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221;']);" >Jefferson&#8217;s &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221;</a>, and Dworkin&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16738" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16738', 'Civil Liberties']);" >Civil Liberties</a>.
