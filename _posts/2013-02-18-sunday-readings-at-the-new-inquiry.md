Do you find it difficult to keep up with all the links I post to Facebook or Twitter? Well, since the start of the year I&#8217;ve been contributing my favorite links to Aaron Bady&#8217;s weekly &#8220;Sunday Reading&#8221; section on <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/author/aaronbady/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thenewinquiry.com/author/aaronbady/', 'his New Inquiry blog']);" >his New Inquiry blog</a>.

While most of us probably feel that we <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything', 'have too much to read']);" >have too much to read</a>, we still find ourselves foolishly looking for something new. Well, look no further than &#8220;Sunday Reading&#8221;! Each week Aaron culls links from a dozen regular contributors and you are bound to find more than a few great articles or websites there each week.

I also archive links on my <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:kerim/bundle:Sundays/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pinboard.in/u:kerim/bundle:Sundays/', 'Pinboard']);" >Pinboard</a> account in case you are looking for something you know I posted but can&#8217;t remember when or where.
