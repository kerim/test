The server for my web site crashed, and had to be <a href="http://forums.hostmatters.com/showthread.php?p=67316#post67316" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://forums.hostmatters.com/showthread.php?p=67316#post67316', 'restored']);" >restored</a> from backup. Some comments may have been lost, since the backup was from the 19th. Sorry about that! Fortunately, I had some of my blog posts saved on my hard drive in <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/', 'ecto']);" >ecto</a>. Everything should be back to normal now!
