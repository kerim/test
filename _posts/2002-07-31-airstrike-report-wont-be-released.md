>   &#8220;AIRSTRIKE REPORT WON&#8217;T BE RELEASED The United Nations said it had decided not to publicly release a report written by a fact-finding team sent to the site of an American airstrike that killed dozens of Afghans, but denied that it was doing so because of pressure from the United States. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the report had been submitted to the United States and Afghan governments, which were conducting their own investigations. According to The Times of London, a preliminary report by the team found that the United States might have understated the death toll and covered up evidence related to the attack. The Pentagon denied that any evidence had been secretly removed. (Reuters)&#8221;
