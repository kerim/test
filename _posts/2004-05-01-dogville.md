Some thoughts upon seeing Lars von Trier&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276919/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276919/', 'latest film']);" >latest film</a>:

  * It was brilliant to shoot the film on a set rather than on location. When making a film about another country it is likely to be the details you get wrong (as he did in the otherwise wonderful <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168629/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168629/', 'Dancer in the Dark']);" >Dancer in the Dark</a>). By eliminating the details, Trier is able to get America right.
  * Trier&#8217;s America is not that of B-movies, as it is for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/', 'Tarantino']);" >Tarantino</a>. Rather, it is the America of John Steinbeck, <a href="http://mbhs.bergtraum.k12.ny.us/cybereng/shorts/lotry.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://mbhs.bergtraum.k12.ny.us/cybereng/shorts/lotry.html', 'Shirley Jackson']);" >Shirley Jackson</a>, and Arthur Miller.
  * Which is not to say that there aren&#8217;t film influences. You can see hints of many a Western, but only in terms of &#8220;atmosphere,&#8221; not much else. [WARNING: Spoilers ahead.] 

  * von Trier has finally made a film with a happy ending (well, at least as close to a happy ending as we can expect of the jolly Dane).
  * Unlike many other film versions of the Christ story (including most of von Trier&#8217;s recent movies), this is one of the few I can think of with a *vengeful* Christ-figure, as opposed to a suffering/forgiving one.
