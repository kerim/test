>   American&#8217;s top man in Baghdad, L. <a href="http://www.menafn.com/qn_print.asp?StoryID=Cp72B0eidAxjHCs1ICMvTzxi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.menafn.com/qn_print.asp?StoryID=Cp72B0eidAxjHCs1ICMvTzxi', 'Paul Bremer, last week fired 28,000 Iraqi teachers as political punishment']);" >Paul Bremer, last week fired 28,000 Iraqi teachers as political punishment</a> for their former membership in the Saddam Hussein-dominated Baath Party, fueling anti-U.S. resistance on the ground, administration officials have told United Press International.


If true, this is truly, truly, stupid. My understanding is that almost anyone who wanted to have a decent government job (including teaching) had to become a Baath Party member in order to keep their job. Imagine if someone &#8220;liberated&#8221; the U.S. and fired everyone who supported George Bush in order to keep their jobs!!!

So now what do we have? Thousands of intellectuals without a job and a deep resentment of the U.S., how is that supposed to help us? What about the need for qualified teachers? You&#8217;d think they would have learned from their equally stupid decision &#8220;to disband without pay the Iraqi military force of 400,000 men&#8221; earlier in the year?
