I&#8217;ve been delinquent in writing up the half a dozen stories on global inequality which I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about, so here they all are in one go:

  * &#8220;the richest 2% of adults in the world <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/12/wealth.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/12/wealth.html', 'own more than half of global household wealth']);" >own more than half of global household wealth</a>.&#8221; 
  * That&#8217;s looking at wealth, rather than income, but Michael Turton sent me a link to this great dynamic chart which tracks <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tools.google.com/gapminder/', 'global income inequality']);" >global income inequality</a> as well as a host of other demographic factors, such as life expectancy and concentration of populations in urban areas. 
  * Michael also has this post about <a href="http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2006/12/m-shaped-taiwan-income.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2006/12/m-shaped-taiwan-income.html', 'income inequality in Taiwan']);" >income inequality in Taiwan</a>. 
  * The importance of wealth, as opposed to income, can be seen in this great editorial piece about inequality in Korea: &#8220;Forty percent of Korean households and half of Seoul&#8217;s citizens don&#8217;t own their own home. The more housing costs rise, the more they help to <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_editorial/178465.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_editorial/178465.html', 'define people&#8217;s class status']);" >define people&#8217;s class status</a>.&#8221; (Thanks <a href="http://kotaji.blogsome.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kotaji.blogsome.com/', 'Kotaji']);" >Kotaji</a>!) 
  * The *NY Times* has two great stories about educational inequality at the college leve. One from the US: &#8220;more leading public universities are striving for national status and drawing increasingly impressive and increasingly affluent students&#8230; In the process, critics say, many are losing force as engines of social mobility, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/education/20colleges.html?ex=1324270800&#038;en=16bd9a2c85e3f6a3&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/education/20colleges.html?ex=1324270800&en=16bd9a2c85e3f6a3&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss', 'shortchanging low-income and minority students']);" >shortchanging low-income and minority students</a>, who are seriously underrepresented on their campuses.&#8221; 
  * And one from India: &#8220;The job market for Indian college graduates is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/business/worldbusiness/30college.html?ex=1322542800&#038;en=3d9992073815201d&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/business/worldbusiness/30college.html?ex=1322542800&en=3d9992073815201d&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss', 'split sharply in two']);" >split sharply in two</a>. With a robust handshake, a placeless accent and a confident walk, you can get a $300-a-month job with Citibank or Microsoft. With a limp handshake and a thick accent, you might peddle credit cards door to door for $2 a day.&#8221; 
  * UPDATE: I should also add these three posts where Brad DeLong and Mark Thoma jump on Alan Reynolds who attempts, in the *Wall Street Journal*, to deny that inequality has risen: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/followup_on_rey.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/followup_on_rey.html', 'here']);" >here</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/intellectual_ga.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/intellectual_ga.html', 'here']);" >here</a>, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/jared_bernstein.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/jared_bernstein.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.
