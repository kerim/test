For months, Hamid Karzai, the interim prime minister, has pleaded for expanding the international peacekeeping force in his country. Currently, these troops &#8212; about 4500 soldiers from 17 nations &#8212; patrol only Kabul and its environs. &#8230; A month ago, the Bush White House was considering backing a plan to double the peacekeeping force in Afghanistan &#8212; while the State Department had advocated beefing it up to 25,000 troops &#8212; but then the Bush administration changed direction and said no to bolstering what&#8217;s officially known as the International Security Assistance Force.
