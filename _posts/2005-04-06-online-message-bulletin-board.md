I wasn&#8217;t surprised that the recent AAA member survey regarding the use of various forms of electronic messaging didn&#8217;t mention wikis, but I thought that it was strange that they didn&#8217;t mention blogs. Unless &#8220;Online Message Bulletin Board&#8221; is a code word for blog?

> Online Message Bulletin Board: a general term for any online &#8220;bulletin board&#8221; where you can leave and expect to see responses to messages you have left. Or you can just search through and read the board. 

Seems possible&#8230; but why not call it a blog? If the newspapers and broadcast media use the word, can&#8217;t the AAA?

Even more disturbing was a series of seven questions regarding access to online documents. In typical survey fashion there was no way to simply state that nothing should be restricted. Instead, I was required to check a list of 9 categories of people I would wish to have access for each of the seven questions. These categories included: the general public, section members, AAA members, meeting registrants, media, colleagues in other disciplines, international colleagues, policymakers, and students. I had to be careful not to check &#8220;no access&#8221; in each item. A more general question about my attitude towards sharing information was on the next page &#8211; after all that clicking&#8230;

Did I mention how crappy the forum software being used for the <a href="http://culturalheritageinternational.org/anthrocommons/about.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://culturalheritageinternational.org/anthrocommons/about.html', 'Anthro Commons']);" >Anthro Commons</a> is? I wish they had just used <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.phpbb.com/', 'PHPBB']);" >PHPBB</a> which is free and open source.
