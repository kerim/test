IN THE MIRROR OF MAYA DEREN, by Martina Kudl&#225;cek.

The film was beautifully shot (somewhat traditionally, considering the subject matter, but it probably would have been a mistake to do it any other way). The filmmaker did a great job of integrating clips of Deren&#8217;s films together with interviews about her life &#8211; really contextualizing her work without psychologizing it. The interviews were good too, presenting a complex and not un-critical view of who Deren was. I don&#8217;t know if the film would much interest people who aren&#8217;t already Deren fans, but for those who are it is a real pleasure. The soundtrack by Zorn was, of course, excellent without getting in the way or drawing attention to itself.
