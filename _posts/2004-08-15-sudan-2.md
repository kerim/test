> The truth is, the media&#8217;s done an excellent job in the last two months of reporting the story, as I noted <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/07/21" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/07/21', 'a few weeks back']);" >a few weeks back</a>. But while the blogosphere has picked up the story, they haven&#8217;t massively amplified it &#8211; <a href="http://www.blogpulse.com/trends.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blogpulse.com/trends.html', 'Blogpulse']);" >Blogpulse</a> shows about 0.03% of blog entries mentioning Darfur and 0.07% mentioning Sudan. While this number has risen substantially in the last couple of months (from a near-whisper), it still is an order of magnitude smaller than the number of blog entries (roughly 0.9%) mentioning Iraq.

He suggests that the story won&#8217;t resonate with people until there are more pictures in the media, and suggests helping <a href="http://www.faithfulamerica.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.faithfulamerica.org/', 'raise $45,000 to send a TV crew to the refugee camps']);" >raise $45,000 to send a TV crew to the refugee camps</a>.

Personally, I&#8217;m fairly amazed that only 0.9% of blog entries mention Iraq. I mean, isn&#8217;t there a war there or something?
