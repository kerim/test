Pushing public-school students toward a religious education may not be against the law, but it certainly is bad education policy. Some parents argue it grants them choice, but a choice between a failing public school and a mediocre parochial school is an unenviable one.

And even if voucher programs conferred more money onto students from failed public schools, there&#8217;s no reason private schools would accept these students &#8212; who, sadly, come from schools that have often failed to teach them basic reading and writing skills, leaving them years behind their peers in private institutions. In Cleveland, the better, suburban private schools banded together and refused to accept vouchers.
