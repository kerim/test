>   &#8220;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled, 5 to 4, in overturning a lower court&#8217;s ruling that the admissions policy used by the law school, on Michigan&#8217;s Ann Arbor campus, illegally discriminated against white applicants. &#8220;We are satisfied that the law school&#8217;s admissions policy sets appropriate limits on the competitive consideration of race and ethnicity,&#8221; the majority said in its written opinion. &#8220;The record indicates that the law school intends to consider race and ethnicity to achieve a diverse and robust student body only until it becomes possible to enroll a &#8216;critical mass&#8217; of underrepresented minority students through race-neutral means.&#8221; The dissenting judges wrote: &#8220;This case involves a straightforward instance of racial discrimination by a state institution.&#8221;&#8221;
