> Of the last four presidential elections won by the Republican candidate, the two closest ones (in 1980 and 2000) would have gone to the Democrat had lower-income people voted in the same percentages as higher-income groups. So suggests an analysis of data from the General Social Survey, a personal interview survey of a representative sample of U.S. households conducted regularly by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.

So says Esther Cervantes and Amy Gluckman in the<a href="http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2004/0104cervantes.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2004/0104cervantes.html', ' January/February issue of Dollars and Sense']);" > January/February issue of Dollars and Sense</a>. What is more, the differences in voting preference between the rich and the poor seems to have increased, even as voter turnout amongst the poor remains low:

> In 2000, a majority of voters in the lowest *four out of five* income quintiles reported choosing the Democratic candidate. In 1980, a majority of voters in *three out of five* income quintiles reported choosing the Democratic candidate, and the fourth quintile was nearly tied. Low- and middle-income people are far less likely to vote, however. As the table shows, the GSS data suggest that there is typically a 25 to 30 percentage-point gap in participation between the lowest and highest income quintiles. The data for every election show a clear pattern: turnout and the portion of the vote going to the Republican candidate both rise as income increases.
