>   &#8220;The Pentagon has not released any figures regarding the number of civilian casualties. But it appears that hundreds of Afghans&#8211;perhaps thousands&#8211;were killed by errant bombs, while others were wounded and/or had their property destroyed. There&#8217;s a growing chorus both in the United States and Afghanistan calling on the US government to help these families, just as the government so compassionately helped the families who lost loved ones on September 11. By helping the Afghan civilian victims of the recent military campaign, we&#8217;ll provide badly needed assistance to people living in desperate conditions, improve our image internationally and move closer toward lasting peace and security.&#8221;
