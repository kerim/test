>   And Mr. Bush then said that if Mexico or other countries oppose the United States, &#8220;there will be a certain sense of discipline.&#8221;

>     These remarks went virtually unreported by the ever-protective U.S. media, but they created a political firestorm in Mexico. The White House has been frantically backpedaling, claiming that when Mr. Bush talked of &#8220;discipline&#8221; he wasn&#8217;t making a threat. But in the context of the rest of the interview, it&#8217;s clear that he was.

>     Moreover, Mr. Bush was disingenuous when he described the backlash against the French as &#8220;not stirred up by anybody except the people.&#8221; On the same day that the report of his interview appeared, The Financial Times carried the headline, &#8220;Hastert Orchestrates Tirade Against the French.&#8221; That&#8217;s Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House of Representatives. In fact, anti-French feeling has been carefully fomented by Republican officials, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s media empire and other administration allies. Can you blame Mexicans for interpreting Mr. Bush&#8217;s remarks as a threat to do the same to them?
