If John Edwards is going to win the primary, he must first clearly differentiate himself from the other candidates. I&#8217;ve been worried that he has been too cautious, too timid about taking on Hillary and Obama. It seems that he was just waiting for one of them to pull ahead as the clear front-runner, bruised from the battle, before he made his move. As the following clips show he has now chosen to attack Hillary on her reluctance to take a strong stance on the war and on her corporate fundraising. Those are easy enough targets, but I think he&#8217;s done a good job of framing his attack so it doesn&#8217;t seem mean-spirited and so that it sets him up as the alternative (not Obama).

To take on Hillary he&#8217;s going to need a lot of money. Have you <a href="https://www.johnedwards.com/action/contribute/form/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.johnedwards.com/action/contribute/form/', 'donated']);" >donated</a> yet?
