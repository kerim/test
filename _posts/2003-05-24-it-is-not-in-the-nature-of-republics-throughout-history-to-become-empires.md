Of course, it all depends on whether you see what is happening now as something new, but Heart&#8217;s remarks are interesting simply because of his desire to enter into the national debate from such a critical perspective:


>   It is not in the nature of republics throughout history to become empires. When Rome made the transition in the first century B.C. it became a vastly different entity. Its character changed. Its values changed from participation to power, from popular sovereignty to the sovereignty of the emperor, from resistant to corruption to corrupt. In a few short months we have gone from a benign internationalist, cooperative, alliance-based nation to a preemptive, unilateralist, aggressive hyper-power.
