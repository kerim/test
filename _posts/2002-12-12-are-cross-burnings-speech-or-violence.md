>   &#8220;No one can deny that cross-burning is criminalized solely because of the message it conveys. And it&#8217;s clear from the justices today that the more they think about this message, the madder they get. Well, doesn&#8217;t that prove Smolla&#8217;s point? That this statute exists only to censor one particularly virulent, hateful message? Not quite, if the justices can massage this "message" into a "threat," as they appear inclined to do. There is a reason we keep talking today about things that happened 100 years ago; it&#8217;s because cross-burnings still symbolize and celebrate that terror and violence, even when they no longer actually threaten it. Oddly, at least for the court, the reminder of a past threat seems to be enough.&#8221;
