There has been a big increase in traffic to this site since the war started. FYI: If you came here from [StandDown][1], then you are probably only seeing my posts about the war. Even though that is about 90% of what is getting blogged these days, you should use the &#8220;All Today&#8217;s KNW Posts&#8221; link on the left to see the rest. Or you can just click here: <http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/>.

Also, if you would like to receive a single e-mail message each day with all of that day&#8217;s posts, simply sign up on the left, where it says: &#8220;Email Updates&#8221;. Just put in your e-mail address and hit &#8220;subscribe&#8221;. This service is provided by <a href="http://www.bloglet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloglet.com', 'Bloglet']);" >Bloglet</a>. What is nice is that if you subscribe to any other blog (and you can add blogs not listed simply by entering their RSS feed) you will still only receive one message a day!

And even though it is a little besides-the-point now, please take a look at the <a href="http://www.nowarwikki.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nowarwikki.org/', 'NoWarWikki']);" >NoWarWikki</a>. If you have your own site please link to this site and the NoWarWikki. Thanks!
