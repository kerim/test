As of December 2003, 247,966 Taiwanese had married foreigners, most of these were men marrying women from Mainland China (over 50%), Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, etc. Most of these women are <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/08/205120" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/08/205120', 'less educated and younger']);" >less educated and younger</a> than the average Taiwanese bride. More importantly, many of these women <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/10/01/2003069953" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/10/01/2003069953', 'don&#8217;t speak Chinese']);" >don&#8217;t speak Chinese</a>. In fact, many are not even literate in their mother tongue. As a result, there has been a major push by activists and social workers to create literacy programs to teach these foreign brides (外籍新娘) Chinese literacy. All this is an extended introduction to a beautiful song recorded by one of my favorite Taiwanese bands: <a href="http://www.leband.net/english/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.leband.net/english/', 'Labor Exchange Band']);" >Labor Exchange Band</a> (<a href="http://www.leband.net/c-index.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.leband.net/c-index.htm', '交工樂隊']);" >交工樂隊</a>). It is a song written by students in one of these literacy programs, to an old Vietnamese song melody.

(It might take a while to load.)

Here are the lyrics:

> After a long period a strange place becomes home  
> (The Song for the Foreign Brides&#8217; Literacy Class)
> 
> The sky&#8217;s so magnificent;  
> the earth&#8217;s so magnificent.  
> The endless Pacific Ocean  
> Thinking of this; thinking of that  
> Where does the road come out at?  
> The sky&#8217;s so vast; the earth&#8217;s so vast.  
> With no relatives, I rely upon my husband.  
> The moon&#8217;s so bright; my heart&#8217;s so agitated.  
> My home&#8217;s so far away  
> Friends&#8217; class, reading class:  
> Coming out from the corner kills loneliness.  
> Reading class, sisters&#8217; class:  
> Reading class connects friends.  
> Sisters&#8217; class, cooperative class:  
> We have mutual trust, mutual love, and mutual help in difficulties.  
> Cooperative class, connections to everywhere:  
> After a long period a strange place becomes home.

(It sounds better in Chinese&#8230;)
