**Guest post by tf

At the risk of turning my first blog posting into a fraternal lovefest, I must take exception with one aspect of <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/11/29/my-mycroft/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/11/29/my-mycroft/', 'my brother&#8217;s characterization of me']);" >my brother&#8217;s characterization of me</a>. I may be his older brother, but I can hardly claim to be his smarter brother. Indeed, I wish that I had a mastery of the literature in my academic field that was even a tenth of the mastery he has of his field&#8217;s literature.

Be that as it may, I&#8217;m thrilled to be here on <a href="http://test.oxus.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/', 'Keywords']);" >Keywords</a> for my debut in the world of blogging. I hope that my perspectives will be of interest to the loyal readership. If readers are shocked that I read *<a href="http://economist.com/index.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://economist.com/index.html', 'The Economist']);" >The Economist</a>*, they will surely be even more shocked to know that I occasionally enjoy browsing over to Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s <a href="http://andrewsullivan.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://andrewsullivan.com/', 'Daily Dish']);" >Daily Dish</a>. But I am sure the readers are happy to engage all reasoned arguments, and I look forward to reading their comments over the next couple of months.
