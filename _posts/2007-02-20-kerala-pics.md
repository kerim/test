With my dissertation, job hunting, filmmaking, moving to Taiwan, starting a new job, etc. we haven&#8217;t had a vacation since our honeymoon seven years ago &#8230; so we decided to take a break and visit Kerala after working on the film last month. It was just 10 days, but we had a fantastic time. I&#8217;ll write more about Kerala later, but here are our photos from the trip:
