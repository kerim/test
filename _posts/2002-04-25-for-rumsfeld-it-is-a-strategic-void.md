Humanitarian aid groups are also clamoring for more peacekeepers and for them to be deployed throughout the country. The stability they engender makes it possible for food and medical care to be delivered to populations hard hit by war and drought. &#8230; But Rumsfeld believes that a large and long-lasting peacekeeping force will only delay the work that has to be done by the factions in Afghanistan to build real stability, according to aides.
