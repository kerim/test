<a href="http://www.lights.com/weblogs/definitions.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lights.com/weblogs/definitions.html', 'Blogs']);" >Blogs</a> can mean lots of different things, from personal diaries to serious journalism. (Did you know that the word &#8220;blog&#8221; has been added to the OED?) I have recently found some good links to serious journalistic blogs, and some of the other stuff as well. They are all listed on my bookmarks page (see below). I will regularly add links to this page, so if you have a favorite blog, let me know!
