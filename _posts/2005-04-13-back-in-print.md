Unfortunately, the realities of the contemporary publishing industry are such that even books which are classics in their field, and which are often required reading for college courses, can go out of print. While ideally it would be nice to see such books released as <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001404.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001404.html', 'open-source online books']);" >open-source online books</a>, the original electronic manuscripts (if they ever existed) for many such older books no longer exist. This means that putting them online or using some print-to-order service would require re-scanning the book, which can be prohibitive. So it is nice to see that at few classics in linguistic anthropology have <a href="http://www.wheatmark.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&#038;Store_Code=BS&#038;Category_Code=CA" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wheatmark.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=BS&Category_Code=CA', 'reappeared']);" >reappeared</a>, including Schieffelin&#8217;s *The Give and Take of Everyday Life*, and Sherzer&#8217;s *Kuna Ways of Speaking*.
