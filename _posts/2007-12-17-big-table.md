For those who haven&#8217;t been following, Obama&#8217;s been doing his best to alienate the progressive left. That&#8217;s resulted in him butting heads with two of my favorite people: John Edwards and Paul Krugman. And while it may result in more corporate fundraising for Obama, he&#8217;s come out looking much worse for the wear.

Obama has framed himself as a candidate who will transcend partisan politics as well as someone who isn&#8217;t afraid to tell tough truths to voters. Those sound good in theory, but in practice it seems to result in Obama rehashing right-wing talking points when criticizing his collegues. He did it over <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/opinion/16krugman.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/opinion/16krugman.html', 'social security']);" >social security</a>, he did it <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/12/8/114117/001" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/12/8/114117/001', 'comparing']);" >comparing</a> his health care plan to those of his opponents, and now he&#8217;s doing it over how he would go about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/opinion/17krugman.html?ex=1355547600&en=29ac7b2a4db031cd&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/opinion/17krugman.html?ex=1355547600&en=29ac7b2a4db031cd&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss', 'implementing health care reform']);" >implementing health care reform</a>.
