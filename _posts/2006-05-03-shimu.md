Who the hell is this &#8220;*shimu*&#8221; everyone is talking about? Well, not everyone &#8211; just our department&#8217;s always helpful and infinitely polite administrative assistant. After noticing my blank stare, she explained that *shimu* 師母 was another word for my wife.

More precisely, it is a way to refer to the wife of a teacher. Not surprisingly there is no equivalent term that means the husband of a female teacher. Following the analogy of hen and rooster (*muji* 母雞 and *gongji* 公雞), the matching phrase should be *shigong* 師公, but that means &#8220;grandmaster&#8221; or &#8220;sorcerer,&#8221; not the husband of a female teacher. *Shimu* is certainly a long way from the sexual-orientation-neutral &#8220;partner&#8221; now favored in U.S. academic circles.

Anyway, <a href="http://www.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shashwati.com/', 'shimu']);" ><em>shimu</em></a> arrives in Taiwan on Saturday &#8230; hopefully once people learn her Chinese name, Xia Xueli 夏雪莉, they&#8217;ll be no need for this formal *shimu* stuff.

UPDATE: <a href="http://jonintaiwan.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://jonintaiwan.blogspot.com/', 'Jon B']);" >Jon B</a>. explains that language doesn&#8217;t always work by analogy. There *is* a term for the teacher&#8217;s husband and it is *shizhang* 師丈. And as both he and Joe correctly point out, it would be horribly rude to call her by her name, so she&#8217;ll be stuck with a title of some kind. (I should also add that it was a Taiwanese graduate student who incorrectly told me there was no equivalent term &#8230; I do try to check with native informants before I publish! I guess I&#8217;ll have to pick my informants better next time.)
