Well, not really, but this is a good article by Joseph Stiglitz (last year&#8217;s winner) on what this year&#8217;s winner has done to help us understand economics a little bit better.


>   &#8220;Among the more amusing results that have come out of experimental economics are those concerning altruism and selfishness. It appears (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists have hypothesized &#8212; except for one group &#8212; the economists themselves.&#8221;
