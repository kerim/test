In an interesting post on <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000566.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000566.html', 'Japanese cell-phone e-mailing']);" >Japanese cell-phone e-mailing</a> (not instant messaging, it turns out), Mark Liberman said something which made my thumbs ache:

> I was told that a well-known violin soloist, <a href="http://www.jinjapan.org/nipponia/nipponia5/cover.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jinjapan.org/nipponia/nipponia5/cover.html', 'Senju Mariko']);" >Senju Mariko</a>, is also a novelist, and does her writing by cell phone, because this enables her to integrate her writing into her busy daily life.

She wrote a novel by texting on her cell phone!? Maybe it helps keep her fingers warmed up for playing violin?
