Gideon Levy, writing in *Haaretz*, asks what the Israeli papers would look like &#8220;<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/452564.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/452564.html', 'if it were the reverse']);" >if it were the reverse</a>&#8220;:

> But when we&#8217;re implicated and the victims are Palestinians, we prefer to avert our eyes, not to know, not to take an interest and certainly not to be shocked. Palestinian victims &#8211; and their numbers, as everyone knows, are far greater than ours &#8211; don&#8217;t even merit newspaper reports, not even when the chain of events is particularly brutal, as in the examples above. This is not an intellectual exercise but an attempt to demonstrate the concealment of information, the double morality and the hypocrisy. The indifference to these two very recent incidents proved again that in our eyes there is only one victim and all the others will never be considered victims.

> If a European cabinet minister were to declare, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want these long-nosed Jews to serve me in restaurants,&#8221; all of Europe would be up in arms and this would be the minister&#8217;s last comment as a minister. Three years ago, our former labor and social affairs minister, Shlomo Benizri, from Shas, stated: &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why slanty-eyed types should be the ones to serve me in restaurants.&#8221; Nothing happened. We are allowed to be racists. And if a European government were to announce that Jews are not permitted to attend Christian schools? The Jewish world would rise up in protest. But when our Education Ministry announces that it will not permit Arabs to attend Jewish schools in Haifa, it&#8217;s not considered racism. Only in Israel could this not be labeled racist. **The heritage of Golda Meir &#8211; it was she who said that after what the Nazis did to us, we can do whatever we want &#8211; is now having a late and unfortunate revival**.
