It seems that <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002170.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002170.html', 'Krugman misses the Reagan years']);" >Krugman misses the Reagan years</a>:

They&#8217;d say, if we have our tax cut we&#8217;ll have this wonderful supply side thing and the economy will boom and it will pay for itself, which was a crazy theory, but it wasn&#8217;t a blatant lie about the actual content of the policy.

>     Bush says, I&#8217;ve got a tax cut that&#8217;s aimed at working people, ordinary working people, and then you just take a look at it and discover that most of it&#8217;s coming from elimination of the estate tax and a cut in the top bracket, so it&#8217;s heavily tilted toward just a handful of people at the top. It&#8217;s just a flat lie about what the tax cut is.

This is from <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002170.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002170.html', 'Calpudit&#8217;s interview with Paul Krugman']);" >Calpudit&#8217;s interview with Paul Krugman</a>. It is this week&#8217;s **must-read** blog article, with some very depressing thoughts on the future of the economy. Will the US be the next Argentina? Krugman thinks it isn&#8217;t impossible &#8211; especially if the Republican&#8217;s stay in power.
