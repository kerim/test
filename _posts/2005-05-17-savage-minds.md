Last September I wrote <a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Welcome_to_the_Blogsphere', 'an article']);" >an article</a> in *Anthropology News* encouraging my fellow anthropologists to get online. I was frustrated that while there are numerous blogs by just about every other branch of academia, anthropologists were still largely absent from the online hubbub. Since I wrote that article, the <a href="http://del.icio.us/kerim/anthropology+blogs" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://del.icio.us/kerim/anthropology+blogs', 'anthropological blogsphere']);" >anthropological blogsphere</a> has been slowly expanding. This was encouraging, especially with blogs like <a href="http://www.antropologi.info/anthropology/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.antropologi.info/anthropology/', 'Anthropology in the News']);" >Anthropology in the News</a>, <a href="http://www.anthroblogs.org/norvell/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.anthroblogs.org/norvell/', 'Motes and Theories on Anthropology']);" >Motes and Theories on Anthropology</a>, <a href="http://www.anthroblog.tadmcilwraith.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.anthroblog.tadmcilwraith.com/', 'Field Notes']);" >Field Notes</a>, <a href="http://meglav.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://meglav.blogspot.com/', 'Safe Space']);" >Safe Space</a>, and newly discovered <a href="http://theoldrevolution.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://theoldrevolution.blogspot.com/', 'The Old Revolution']);" >The Old Revolution</a>, all of which were much more anthropologically focused than the older anthropologist-authored blogs, like my own, that were only occasionally or tangentially anthropological. Spurred on by these newcomers, four of us who have been blogging for quite some time: <a href="http://alex.golub.name/log/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://alex.golub.name/log/index.php', 'Alex']);" >Alex</a>, <a href="http://www.onemansopinion.org/pivot/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.onemansopinion.org/pivot/', 'Dustin']);" >Dustin</a>, <a href="http://hunjang.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hunjang.blogspot.com/', 'Antti']);" >Antti</a>, and myself got together to start an anthropology group blog, in the tradition of <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crookedtimber.org/', 'Crooked Timber']);" >Crooked Timber</a>, <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thevalve.org/', 'The Valve']);" >The Valve</a>, <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/', 'Language Log']);" >Language Log</a>, <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/2.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hnn.us/blogs/2.html', 'Cliopatria']);" >Cliopatria</a>. The result is <a href="http://savageminds.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org', 'Savage Minds']);" >Savage Minds</a>!

One of the goals of Savage Minds, besides encouraging ourselves to write more about anthropology, is to also encourage other anthropologists to blog. Accordingly, we have two &#8220;newcomers&#8221; to the world of blogging. <a href="http://savageminds.org/chris/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/chris/', 'Chris Kelty']);" >Chris Kelty</a>, who has written extensively about technology and intellectual property, and <a href="http://savageminds.org/nancy/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/nancy/', 'Nancy Leclerc']);" >Nancy Leclerc</a> who studies &#8220;gender, sexual behaviour and human relations.&#8221; As we get established we hope to bring newer members on board as well. And hopefully some guest appearances by more established anthropologists.

Since we launched yesterday there are already a bunch of new posts. I wrote about <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/15/vox-populi/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/15/vox-populi/', 'informants who like being interviewed']);" >informants who like being interviewed</a> a little too much. Alex wrote about the continued importance of <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/four-sick-fields/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/four-sick-fields/', 'all four fields']);" >all four fields</a> in anthropology. (With a followup <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/more-on-disciplinarity/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/more-on-disciplinarity/', 'here']);" >here</a>.) And Dustin has commented on <a href="http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/the-anarchist-in-the-academy/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/2005/05/16/the-anarchist-in-the-academy/', 'the David Graeber affair']);" >the David Graeber affair</a>, placing it in a wider historical context. Even more exciting, there has already been some active discussion in the comments!

One thing I haven&#8217;t decided yet is whether to mirror my <a href="http://savageminds.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org', 'Savage Minds']);" >Savage Minds</a> posts here or not. I think I will probably do &#8220;round-up&#8221; posts instead &#8211; pointing to those posts which have a broader appeal outside the world of anthropology, but not everything I write over there. *Keywords* will continue to be home to my more political, linguistic, Taiwan focused and eclectic thoughts, although it is unlikely that I will be posting as much here as I did before.

For more information about the blog&#8217;s name, and the reason we have pansies in our masthead, see <a href="http://savageminds.org/about-savage-minds/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://savageminds.org/about-savage-minds/', 'our about page']);" >our about page</a>. There are also some nice graphics there that you can use to help spread the word!<!-- technorati tags start -->
