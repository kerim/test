A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/arts/television/02public.html?ex=1272686400&#038;en=4e1a4fc43fa3d5db&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/arts/television/02public.html?ex=1272686400&en=4e1a4fc43fa3d5db&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss', 'NY Times story']);" ><em>NY Times</em> story</a> about Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, Republican chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), describes him as pressuring PBS to &#8220;adhere to the &#8216;objectivity and balance&#8217; language in the charter.&#8221; How did he see fit to exert such pressure? In addition to hiring an outside consultant to keep a list of guests who appeared on *<a href="http://www.pbs.org/now" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/now', 'Now, with Bill Moyers']);" >Now, with Bill Moyers</a>*, he also personally raised the money necessary to get *[The Journal Editorial Report][1]*, with Paul Gigot, editor of the *Wall Street Journal* on PBS.

How has this helped create &#8220;objectivity and balance&#8221; on PBS?

> Public television executives noted that Mr. Gigot&#8217;s show by design features the members of the conservative editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, while Mr. Moyers&#8217;s guests included many conservatives, like Ralph Reed, former head of the Christian Coalition; Richard Viguerie, a conservative political strategist; and Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.

So a show with balanced news coverage has now been &#8220;balanced&#8221; by pairing it with a show run by &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_04/006194.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_04/006194.php', 'the most dishonest editorial page in the country']);" >the most dishonest editorial page in the country</a>.&#8221;<!-- technorati tags start -->
