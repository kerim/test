From what I can tell, <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/06/04/2003053866" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/06/04/2003053866', 'this']);" >this</a> doesn&#8217;t really mean very much, but at least they are talking about it. I personally wonder how the details would work if they did get these autonomous regions going:


>   The Executive Yuan yesterday passed a draft bill on the establishment of the Aboriginal autonomous region, but Aboriginal lawmakers expressed lukewarm opinions over the government initiative.
