Lost, in no particular order,

  * The lives of more soldiers fighting more senseless wars
  * Health care reform
  * A raise in the minimum wage
  * Women&#8217;s right to choose
  * Civil liberties
  * Separation of church and state
  * Balanced budgets
  * Wilderness preserves
  * The Supreme Court
  * Science

The only hope is that now that the Republicans will turn upon each other. Can Bush keep the same strict party discipline he&#8217;s had over the past 4 years?

And are we really stuck with Hillary in &#8217;08? Will all this drive the Democratic party even more towards the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">center</span> right, or will they finally learn their lesson?

> Ever since the Iraq War officially became a debacle, Democrats have nailed Bush for not holding anyone in his cabinet accountable. But who do Democrats hold accountable for what appears to be a resounding Republican victory?
