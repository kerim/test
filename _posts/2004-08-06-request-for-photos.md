Organizers of an exhibition in Australia are <a href="http://www.whentheworldsaidno.org/submit.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whentheworldsaidno.org/submit.php', 'looking for photos']);" >looking for photos</a> from around the world from the February 2003 anti-war march. It seems like a great idea to document this, although I personally wish they planned to make the entire exhibition available online, rather than in a book.

> In February 2003, 30 million people around the world marched as one to oppose war. That number is greater than the populations of most countries and continues to grow.

> <a href="http://www.whentheworldsaidno.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whentheworldsaidno.org/', 'When The World Said No To War']);" >When The World Said No To War</a> aims to illustrate the huge scale of the opposition not only to the war in Iraq, but to all war and to inspire those who come in contact with it, to continue to work for peace.
> 
> The exhibition and book will consist of a collection of powerful images plus writing contributions from some of the world&#8217;s most well-known thinkers, writers, and visionaries. The education forum will consist of films and videos, plays, music, lectures, and panel discussions centred around the theme of peace.
> 
> The project is not politically aligned and all funds raised will be put back into the project.
