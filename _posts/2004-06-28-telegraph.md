Read this <a href="http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/bureaucracy.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/bureaucracy.htm', 'hilarious series of telegraphs']);" >hilarious series of telegraphs</a> between British colonial officials in 1916, there is a punch-line at the end, so read the whole thing. Here is how it starts:

> January 1st. F.O. to Cairo  
> 101. Greek Prime Minister wishes to import grain. Can you do this?
> 
> January 4th. Cairo to F.O.  
> 416. Your 101 not understood. Where does he want to import? Is it into Egypt?

Its all downhill from there. This is an excerpt from a book entitled, *<a href="http://www.britishempire.co.uk/library/leisure.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.britishempire.co.uk/library/leisure.htm', 'The Leisure of an Egyptian Official']);" >The Leisure of an Egyptian Official</a>*, containing antidotes from the life of Lord Edward Cecil, originally published in 1921.
