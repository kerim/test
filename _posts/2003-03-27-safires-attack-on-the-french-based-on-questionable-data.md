>   After reading Safire&#8217;s first column, as a former producer with &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; my curiosity was piqued. I looked into his charges, and found they didn&#8217;t hold together. Interestingly, another American reporter also dug into the matter, and informed his desk that Safire&#8217;s case didn&#8217;t stand up.
