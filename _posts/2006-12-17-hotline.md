After making fun of the <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/12/15/go-go-go-good-good-good/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2006/12/15/go-go-go-good-good-good/', 'railway web site']);" >railway web site</a>, I think it is only fair to give praise where praise is due.

The <a href="http://iff.npa.gov.tw/enfront/index.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iff.npa.gov.tw/enfront/index.php', 'International Community Service Hotline']);" >International Community Service Hotline</a> has an excellent bilingual web page full of just about every question a foreign resident might need to know. And, as the name suggests, they also have a bilingual phone service:

0800-024-111

I didn&#8217;t test their English ability, but the woman I spoke with was very helpful and seemed to anticipate every question I had!

UPDATE: It seems that the government is too incompetent to redirect users when they change the URL. Here is the <a href="http://iff.immigration.gov.tw/enfront/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://iff.immigration.gov.tw/enfront/', 'new site']);" >new site</a>.
