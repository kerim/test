<a href="http://www.utah-sex-offenders.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.utah-sex-offenders.com/', 'This site']);" >This site</a>, using Google maps to show the location of all convicted sex offenders in Utah has me really freaked out. On the one hand, having entered the sample address: &#8220;185 S State, Salt Lake City, UT 84111&#8243; to test the service out, I&#8217;m shocked at how many people are listed in the neighborhood. But it is even more disturbing to see their pictures, and descriptions of the crimes they were convicted of. I can understand parents wanting to know if there is a child abuser living near them, but I also wonder: do we really want to brand people for life? Isn&#8217;t there some concept of having &#8220;paid your debt&#8221; and &#8220;served your sentence&#8221;? With internet tools making it this easy to identify people, they might as well have a scarlet letter tattooed on their foreheads&#8230;
