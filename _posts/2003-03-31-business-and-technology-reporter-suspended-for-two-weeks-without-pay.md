>   San Francisco Chronicle business and technology reporter Henry Norr has been suspended for two weeks without pay after having been arrested in an anti-war protest in downtown San Francisco, the <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/5502455.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/5502455.htm', 'Mercury News']);" >Mercury News</a> reports.

>     The suspension is mired in controversy, because Norr&#8217;s employers claim he was disciplined not for the protest arrest, but for time card misrepresentations &#8230; [He asked for sick leave.

We think the Chronicle should reconsider.
