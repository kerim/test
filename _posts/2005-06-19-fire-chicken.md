Language Log&#8217;s Mark Liberman has <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002248.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002248.html', 'put his finger']);" >put his finger</a> on a common phenomenon which drives me batty: people using (often incorrect or folk) etymology to make philosophical points. Here is how Liberman describes the rhetorical structure of such arguments:

> In \[language X], the word for [concept Y] is based on the word for [concept Z\] (or perhaps, a combination of the words for [concept Z1] and [concept Z2]). Therefore, in order to understand [concept Y], you should think in terms of [concept Z], recognizing the deep traditional wisdom inherent in the lexicographic history of [language X].

Usually the language in question is one associated with what is perceived as an ancient and wise culture: Chinese, Greek, or <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002251.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002251.html', 'Hebrew']);" >Hebrew</a>.

Now, if I were to tell you that the Chinese word for a turkey 火雞 is made up of the words for &#8220;fire&#8221; 火 and &#8220;chicken&#8221; 雞, you probably wouldn&#8217;t think I was saying anything particularly profound. But if you were a turkey in a world full of chickens, it might sound pretty cool, maybe even profound&#8230;

UPDATE: Looking at my post I realize that my attempt at a cute Chinese example doesn&#8217;t follow Mark&#8217;s schema in the slightest. In fact, I was using the model discussed in <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/002110.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/002110.html', 'this older Language Log post']);" >this older Language Log post</a>. Equally annoying, but certainly different.
