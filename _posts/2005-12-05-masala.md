> For the future, Talukdar hopes to turn a screenplay she just finished into a film. *Double Vision* is a sci-fi thriller with a South Asian American female as the main character. “I’d love to make it,” she says, “You never really see South Asian American women in action films.” Talukdar has tired of the standard arranged-marriage plots. “There’s more to explore,” she says. “People seem to have bigger lives than we see… I never want to make a film with a food item in the name,” she jokes, alluding to the preponderance of films with masala or chai in their titles. “The breadth of what [Talukdar is] capable of is so much bigger than that,” explains Friedman.
