One of our main goals for <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com/', 'the film']);" >the film</a> is to create awareness about the plight of India&#8217;s Denotified Tribes, but we also want to turn that awareness into direct action. To this end we&#8217;ve been working hard to set up a US-based 501c3 nonprofit which can collect donations on the behalf of the communities we are working with in India. We are working with a <a href="http://www.bhasharesearch.org.in/Site.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bhasharesearch.org.in/Site.html', 'respected Indian NGO']);" >respected Indian NGO</a> to create a variety of cultural and educational programs which we are very excited about.

We&#8217;ll have more details about this new organization soon, but right now we need someone to help us design a logo. There are lots of sites out there that will do a logo for a <a href="https://www.logoworks.com/client-app/showPackageSelection.do" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.logoworks.com/client-app/showPackageSelection.do', 'flat fee']);" >flat fee</a>, but we&#8217;d like something a little less <a href="https://www.logoworks.com/Logo-design-recent-logos.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.logoworks.com/Logo-design-recent-logos.html', 'corporate looking']);" >corporate looking</a>, preferably something with an Indian flair. Unfortunately, as a new nonprofit with absolutely no money in the bank, we can&#8217;t afford to pay what a large corporation would pay, but we don&#8217;t expect anyone to do this for free either. We are hoping to get either an experienced professional willing to cut a nonprofit some slack, or a talented new designer looking to make a name for him or herself.

We are also looking for experienced web designers to help us create custom WordPress themes for a couple of websites we are working on in relation to the film.

If you are interested in either job let us know in the comments, or via our <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/contact/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/contact/', 'contact form']);" >contact form</a>. Please include links to samples of your work and let us know what you charge. Thanks!

UPDATE: We&#8217;ve already hired <a href="http://www.aside.in/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.aside.in/', 'a logo designer']);" >a logo designer</a>. Still looking for someone to help out with web design.
