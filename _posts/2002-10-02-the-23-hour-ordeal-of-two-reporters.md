>   &#8220;Two Diamondback reporters covering the IMF-World Bank protests were arrested Friday morning and manacled for 23 hours. Surrounded by hundreds of protesters in Pershing Park, Washington Metropolitan Police circled and arrested the entire group. Jason Flanagan and Debra Kahn were there as impartial observers, and despite the newspaper&#8217;s efforts to release them, they were stripped of all their possessions &#8211; even their shoelaces. What follows is a first-person account of their arrest and detention.&#8221;
