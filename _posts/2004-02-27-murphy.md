<img src="http://test.oxus.net/images/hist_01.jpg" height="195" width="198" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Murphy In-A-Dor Bed" />I&#8217;ve only seen <a href="http://murphybedcompany.com/home.php?section=history" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://murphybedcompany.com/home.php?section=history', 'Murphy beds']);" >Murphy beds</a> in movies, and then usually as part of some joke where someone accidentally gets folded away with the bed in the closet. So I was very happy to read a story about them in the Jackson Heights newsletter, *Views form the Heights*. The story is by Robyn Einhorn, an MA candidate at Parsons School of Design who is researching the Murphy Bed.

> The true Murphy Bed is a metal frame attached to a steel reinforced doorjamb with a patented hinge that swings the bed out from the door into the room. It was the invention of William Lawrence Murphy [1856-1957]. &#8230;. William Lawrence Murphy lived in a one-room apartment. He began to tinker with hide-away beds after he became smitten with a &#8220;fine young lady.&#8221; The woman came form a good background, her father was an engineer for the San Francisco cable cars, and she an educated opera singer. Courting in those days would not permit a lady to enter a gentleman&#8217;s bedroom; indirectly, William Lawrence invented the in-A-Door-bed because he fell in love. With his new invention, he safely stowed away his bed, transformed his one room apartment into a proper parlor, and was free to have a female caller. &#8220;The cowboy, William lawrence married the opera singer, Gladys, in the early 1900s.&#8221; Now, his hobby of experimenting with hide away beds was a full-time business.

It seems that the Queensboro Corporation, which developed <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/feature/37418/history.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://newyork.citysearch.com/feature/37418/history.html', ' Jackson Heights']);" > Jackson Heights</a>, put Murphy beds in many of their buildings.

NOTE: If you live in the area had have an In-A-Dor Bed, or have vintage photographs of such beds, email Robyn at: robyn_e [at] hotmail [dot] com.
