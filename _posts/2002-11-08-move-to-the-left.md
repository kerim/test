Is it too much to hope for a Democratic shift to the Left? As someone recently pointed out on a blog somewhere in cyberspace: &#8220;If voters wanted to elect conservatives they would vote for Republicans. And they did!&#8221; Also, see <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thismodernworld.com/', 'Tom Tomorrow']);" >Tom Tomorrow</a> who points out that the number of voters responsible for the Republican victory is quite small. Without choices most people won&#8217;t even vote!


>   &#8220;Just one day after entering the race for House minority leader, Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas) dropped out and threw his support to House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Frost&#8217;s decision came as Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.) announced his intention to run against Pelosi for leader, although it is widely expected that Pelosi will win the top job.&#8221;
