This means, that as long as the investigation continues, SJP is functionally barred from holding events on campus, tabling, distributing literature, and organizing. It could also potentially mean that SJP may be banned as a student organization at Berkeley.

Please note, that while the University of California is &#8220;investigating&#8221; and &#8220;only considering&#8221; suspension, these measures are a prelude to worse sanctions, not to mention only applied to SJP (even though many student groups have participated in and conducted civil disobedience on campus).
