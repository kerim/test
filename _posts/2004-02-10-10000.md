> More than 10,000 civilians, many of them women and children, have been killed so far in the Iraqi conflict, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=489082" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=489082', 'The Independent on Sunday has learnt']);" >The Independent on Sunday has learnt</a>, making the continuing conflict the most deadly war for non-combatants waged by the West since the Vietnam war more than 30 years ago.

The number, 10,000, comes from the work of the website <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.iraqbodycount.net/', 'Iraq Body Count']);" >Iraq Body Count</a>, which deliberately errs on the side of caution &#8211; only counting deaths reported in at least two media outlets.

Counting civilian causalities was a hotly contested issue before the war, when wildly variant numbers were being thrown out in regards to the impact of sanctions. As part of a brilliant (what else?) post from Jeanne at <a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/', 'Body and Soul']);" >Body and Soul</a> on the topic of &#8220;<a href="http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/how_centrists_t.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bodyandsoul.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/how_centrists_t.html', 'Morality and Foreign Policy']);" >Morality and Foreign Policy</a>,&#8221; she points out that the author of one of the more conservative estimates has recently upped his numbers.

Garfield has since <a href="http://www.casi.org.uk/discuss/2002/msg00274.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.casi.org.uk/discuss/2002/msg00274.html', 'increased that estimate']);" >increased that estimate</a>. Children are not the only ones to have died, either, though presumably they form the bulk of the victims.
