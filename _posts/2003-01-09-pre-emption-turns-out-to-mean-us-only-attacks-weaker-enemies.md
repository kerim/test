>   &#8220;"What the cases of North Korea and Iraq show is that if the threat is genuinely serious, the pre-emption doctrine is not pursued," said Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Carter&#8217;s national security adviser.

It is less risky and more satisfying to beat up someone who is less threatening than more threatening."
