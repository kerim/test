The same thing happened to me. I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/domsupgroup.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paulgraham.com/domsupgroup.html', 'linking']);" >linking</a> to this site so that it will come up in more Google Searches. I hope it helps!!!


>   I was recently cold-called (on my cell phone) by a company called the Domain Support Group, which the woman on the phone said was a &#8220;transfer notification agent.&#8221; I have been dealing with domain names for many years and I had never heard of &#8220;a transfer notification agent.&#8221; I was suspicious, and it turns out I was right to be.
