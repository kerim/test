Just some of the many good questions Eric Alterman asks:




>   &#8220;Why did the Bush national security team ignore the Al Qaeda briefing it received from President Clinton&#8217;s National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, in the fall of 2000? 
>   
>   
>     Why did the President ignore the August 2001 intelligence briefing warning him of the likelihood of an Al Qaeda hijacking?
>   
>   
>   
>     Why, in August 2000, was the FBI unable to locate Al Qaeda operatives Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq al-Hazmi, both of whom had been placed at a terrorist planning meeting by Malaysian intelligence in December 1999? Hazmi was listed in the San Diego telephone directory and Midhar was using a credit card with his name on it. Both were active at the San Diego Islamic Center.

And I think it is worth adding that the president&#8217;s &#8220;pre-emptive strike&#8221; proposal suggests that we plan these strikes based on &#8230; US Intellegence!!!!!!!!
