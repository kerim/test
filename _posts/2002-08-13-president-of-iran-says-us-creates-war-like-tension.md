>   &#8220;The events of Sept. 11 were horrific, but the American leaders mis-used them, too," the Iranian leader said at a news conference in the old royal palace here that followed talks with Afghanistan&#8217;s President Hamid Karzai. "They did it because they wanted to create an atmosphere of violence and war in the world, but we know with certainty that in today&#8217;s world all our fates are linked."

>     Mr. Khatami continued: "It&#8217;s obvious that if you attack somewhere, it will reverberate elsewhere as well. Those who plan to launch this war shouldn&#8217;t think that the effects will be felt only where they attack. In today&#8217;s world, violence and oppression will only foster more violence. To believe that you can make people submit by force is wrong. We know that this approach only brings anger and destruction."&#8221;
