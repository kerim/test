I didn&#8217;t know <a href="http://fablog.ehrensteinland.com/archives/000140.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fablog.ehrensteinland.com/archives/000140.shtml', 'the full story']);" >the full story</a>:

> Well over a decade ago she was a PR rep for &#8220;Coors,&#8221; called into action to repair the damage caused by one of the most successful boycotts in U.S. history and don&#8217;t you forget it for a nanosecond!
> 
> The Coors family is, as the say, to the right of Atilla the Hun. They utilized their earnings to create and fund anti-gay orgs back in the 70&#8217;s and made no secret of that fact. Gay liberation &#8230; responded by calling for a boycott of &#8220;Coors&#8221; beer. Almost overnight gay and lesbian bars nationwide refused to stock the swill, and gays and lesbians from sea to shining sea refused to buy it.

> And so by the mid-80&#8217;s the company, desperate for good PR, tried a new tack. They pretended the Coors family wasn&#8217;t really involved with the &#8220;Coors&#8221; company. They declared an end to sexual orientation discrimination in their hiring practices, going so far as to offer same-sex partner benefits to gay and lesbian employees. And they hired Mary Cheney to go all around the country hat in hand to tell gay/lesbian orgs that &#8220;Coors&#8221; had mended its ways and that it&#8217;s (awful) beer was now OK to drink.
