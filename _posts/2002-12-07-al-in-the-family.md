The American Prospect writes about two new books by Al Gore. I have to say that Gore seems to be trying very hard to make himself different from the Republicans.


>   &#8220;Can Democrats take on family-values issues inclusively without committing political suicide? Joined at the Heart sure tries to, attempting to expand the bounds of permissible political speech and revive some old Clintonian ideals. One of Bill Clinton&#8217;s genius realizations, speechwriter David Kusnet once noted, was the recognition that for most Americans, the ordinary life is an achievement. In Joined at the Heart, Gore recognizes that we do not live the lives we hope to; we live the lives we can. And that very often, we need help from government to mitigate the external factors that combine with our own internal limitations to create family collapse.&#8221;
