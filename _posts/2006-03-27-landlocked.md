For developing countries, being landlocked poses a <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/articles/ViewPopUpArticle.jsp?id=6&#038;articleId=3386" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.opendemocracy.net/articles/ViewPopUpArticle.jsp?id=6&articleId=3386', 'special burden']);" >special burden</a>:

> Consider these statistics. Outside of western and central Europe, the average income of landlocked countries is just $1,771, compared with $5,567 for coastal nations. It has been estimated that growth rates of the world&#8217;s thirty-one landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) are 0.7-1% lower than they might otherwise have been, as a direct result of their being landlocked. The UN Human Development Index reads like a grim advertisement for the benefits of a coastal existence: life expectancy in LLDCs is 3.5 years lower than in their maritime neighbours, and education index scores are 0.36 lower, on a scale of 0 to 1. Nine of the world&#8217;s twenty poorest countries are landlocked, and sixteen of the thirty LLDCs are classified as &#8220;least developed&#8221;. 

Not only are land transport costs much higher than by sea, but the bureaucratic hurdles of getting goods across borders adds considerable cost as well.
