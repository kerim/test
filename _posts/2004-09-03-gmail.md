Free stuff! I have a bunch of <a href="http://gmail.google.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmail.google.com/', 'Gmail']);" >Gmail</a> invites to give away if anyone wants one. Gmail is Google&#8217;s new web based e-mail service, and they offer 1 GB of storage for free. However, because it is in beta you can only get an account if a current user sends you an invite.

If you are interested, leave a comment, or e-mail me. When the invites are all used up I&#8217;ll post an update here.

More information on Gmail can be found on <a href="http://wiki.oxus.net/Web_%26_Email_Hosting#Gmail" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wiki.oxus.net/Web_%26_Email_Hosting#Gmail', 'my wiki']);" >my wiki</a>.

UPDATE: Rather than wait for people to request these, I&#8217;m going to send them to <a href="http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://isnoop.net/gmailomatic.php', 'this site']);" >this site</a>. You can request an invite there.
