July will be slow around here. I&#8217;m upstate and can only get broadband intermittently. I&#8217;ll try to keep posting, but I can&#8217;t promise anything! If you see any good posts this month, (or want me to take a look at something on your blog) please post the URL to the comments section of this entry so I don&#8217;t miss it.

Here are some links worth taking a look at:
