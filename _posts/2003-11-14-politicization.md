Marstonalia has some interesting ideas about <a href="http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_11_09_marston_archive.html#106865699203407970" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_11_09_marston_archive.html#106865699203407970', 'what can be done to &#8220;stop&#8221; the downward spiral in the politicization of the judicial confirmation process']);" >what can be done to &#8220;stop&#8221; the downward spiral in the politicization of the judicial confirmation process</a>. (Hint: do nothing.)

And don&#8217;t miss an equally interesting discussion about <a href="http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_11_09_marston_archive.html#106861063544198431" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://marston.blogspot.com/archives/2003_11_09_marston_archive.html#106861063544198431', 'takings']);" >takings</a>. &#8220;Takings&#8221; is a legal theory which claims that government regulations should be seen as &#8220;taking&#8221; away rights from property holders &#8211; rights for which they should be reimbursed. Of course, they don&#8217;t consider labor exploitation to be a &#8220;taking&#8221; &#8211; at least not that I&#8217;ve seen. Nor do they want to apply such rules retroactively, to Native Americans whose land was the first to be &#8220;taken&#8221;, or to the descendants of slaves &#8230;. but I digress. Marstonalia&#8217;s discussion is much more specific.
