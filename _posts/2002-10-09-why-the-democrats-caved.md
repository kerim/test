The reason the democrats caved is no big mystery. This way they don&#8217;t have to take responsibility. By passing the buck to Bush, the war will be his responsibility, and if not going to war was the wrong thing to do, it won&#8217;t be the Democrat&#8217;s responsibility either.


>   &#8220;BUSH&#8217;S BIG SPEECH. Here&#8217;s the text, courtesy of The New York Times. Here&#8217;s a Washington Post piece explaining how the Democrats basically caved, a phenomenon which we will enjoy watching be dissected in some magazine article or another soon. (It&#8217;s a mystery, especially when polls show most Americans feeling the very same doubts that the Democrats do about a unilateral invasion. It&#8217;s like Bush has them mesmerized.)&#8221;
