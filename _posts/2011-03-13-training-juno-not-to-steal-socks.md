If we come downstairs before Juno she will often sneak into the bedroom (where she isn&#8217;t allowed) and steal socks from the laundry basket. (Somehow she always manages to steal a matching pair!) When she comes downstairs she will then dance around looking somewhat ashamed, with her tail between her leg, as if to say: &#8220;Look at me, I&#8217;ve been a baaaad dog. Shouldn&#8217;t I be punished?&#8221; Of course, it is all just an elaborate ruse for attention, so we mostly ignore her. 

Unfortunately, ignoring her hasn&#8217;t cured her of the habit. Nor do we always remember to close the bedroom door. So we decided on a new approach: rewarding her for coming down the stairs *without* socks in her mouth. We thought this worked when, this morning, she came down without any socks; but, it turns out, that she had still stolen the socks, but simply dropped them at the top of the stairs so she could get her cookie!
