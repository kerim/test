As Kerry solidifies his lead as the Democratic frontrunner, I decided it was time I learned something about who he is. Everyone knows some of the more widely publicized facts of his life: that he was a Vietnam war hero who then became a leading anti-war activist, that his paternal grandparents were Czech Jews who converted to Catholicism and adopted Irish-sounding names, that his second wife, the widow of Republican Senator Heinz, is one of the richest women in the country, that he rides a motorcycle, and that he voted in support of giving Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. But none of these things really give me a sense of what kind of a person he is, or what kind of a president (or Democratic presidential candidate) he might make.

Fortunately, there is an abundance of information on the web (see below for links). After slogging through a lot of it, I came away with the impression of a very ambitious man, who was something of a &#8220;maverick&#8221; in the Senate. At various points in his career he has been passionate about a few key issues: the Vietnam war, Nuclear Disarmament, the Iran-Contra affair and, most recently, the environment. But he is not someone with a larger message or &#8220;vision.&#8221;

A lot of discussion rests on his legislative record, in which he seems to have <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3679&#38;R=9D0B27CD7" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3679&R=9D0B27CD7', 'notoriously flip-flopped']);" >notoriously flip-flopped</a> on a number of issues. His defenders say that his problem is that his policies are simply too &#8220;fine-tuned&#8221; to reduce to a clear either-or position. Like I said &#8211; he isn&#8217;t someone with a &#8220;message.&#8221;

That he doesn&#8217;t have a message is a mixed blessing. I personally feel that the Democrats need more of a message if they are going to swing this country away from GOP rule. On the other hand, that he is hard to pin down or caricature might make him more &#8220;electable.&#8221;

There are certainly some things I&#8217;ve found that I quite like about Kerry:

  * He is against the death penalty. (At least within the criminal justice system, he&#8217;s qualified his position for &#8220;terrorists.&#8221;) 
      * His involvement in Iran-contra (and even his bills to reduce the budget of teh intelligence community) shows someone who is willing to take on the kind of shady-deal foreign policy which has gotten us into the mess we are in right now. 
          * He even <a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml', 'took on a banking scandal']);" >took on a banking scandal</a> that hurt fellow democrats. (Hence his reputation as a maverick.) 
              * Although he is not free of the hint of scandal himself (see the above link), he hasn&#8217;t done anything that seem like it would be too great a liability. He earned his money the old fashioned way &#8211; he married it. <a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml', 'As did his dad']);" >As did his dad</a> &#8211; there is a reason why Kerry&#8217;s middle name is &#8220;Forbes.&#8221; 
                  * He has a good record on the environment. 
                      * He has been <a href="http://www.ufw.org/2104kerry.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ufw.org/2104kerry.htm', 'endorsed by the UFW']);" >endorsed by the UFW</a>. </ul> 
                        What I like less about Kerry:
                        
                          * Even though he voted against the gay marriage bill he has come out against gay marriage. 
                              * He has been <a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062103.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062103.shtml', 'quoted as saying']);" >quoted as saying</a> &#8220;affirmative action has kept America thinking in racial terms&#8221; as well as attacking America&#8217;s &#8220;culture of dependency,.&#8221; Even if he was trying to sound like Clinton in the hopes of being picked as a running-mate, they aren&#8217;t the kind of things I like my candidates to be saying. I strongly believe the democrats need to redefine the debate on poverty, not pander to the right. 
                                  * I don&#8217;t like his <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3679&#38;R=9D0B27CD7" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=3679&R=9D0B27CD7', 'mixed voting record']);" >mixed voting record</a> on the wars in Iraq. Again, it is the &#8220;vision&#8221; thing &#8211; he seems to lack the clarity of vision that makes a leader. But maybe his ability to compromise will enable him to work with a Republican congress if he is elected? Still, no matter how you spin it &#8211; I still hold it against him. </ul> 
                                    For the anyone but Bush camp, which I am in, Kerry seems to be as good a choice as any of the other Democratic frontrunners. Although I have researched Edwards less thoroughly, I like the fact that he is able to articulate a clear and powerful message in a way that Kerry cannot; but there is a lot to like about Kerry, and not too much baggage that might be used against him.
