Andrea Dworkin, who <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1457325,00.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1457325,00.html', 'died']);" >died</a> today, <a href="http://www.radgeek.com/gt/2005/01/10/andrea_dworkin" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.radgeek.com/gt/2005/01/10/andrea_dworkin', 'never claimed']);" >never claimed</a> that all heterosexual sex is rape.

> statements that Dworkin makes about the meaning of intercourse are *routinely* misinterpreted as statements made in *propia voce* [in her own voice] when in fact they are statements of the meaning attributed to intercourse by *male supremacist culture* and enforced *by the material conditions (economic vulnerability, violence) that women face under patriarchy*. These are meanings that Dworkin, among other things, intends to *criticize*&#8230;
