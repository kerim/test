If, as <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html?uc_full_date=20050715" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html?uc_full_date=20050715', 'Doonesbury suggests']);" >Doonesbury suggests</a>, the terrorists really are after us because they hate freedom, there may be no need to fear any longer. The NLRB has ruled that it is <a href="http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/workersrights/eye7_2005.cfm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/workersrights/eye7_2005.cfm', 'perfectly legal']);" >perfectly legal</a> for an employer to ban workers from socializing on their free time! When I first read this on <a href="http://www.chinastudygroup.org/blog/jj/206/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chinastudygroup.org/blog/jj/206/', 'JJ&#8217;s blog']);" >JJ&#8217;s blog</a> I thought it must be a mistake of some kind, but Nathan Newman <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/laborblog/archive/003273.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/laborblog/archive/003273.shtml', 'confirms']);" >confirms</a> that its the case. In fact, so does the *<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/09/AR2005080901162_pf.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/09/AR2005080901162_pf.html', 'Washington Post']);" >Washington Post</a>*:

> They&#8217;ll be bowling alone at Guardsmark tonight. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) doesn&#8217;t want the employees chatting it up off the job.

> On June 7 &#8230; They upheld the legality of a regulation for uniformed employees at Guardsmark, a security guard company, that reads, &#8220;[Y]ou must NOT . . . fraternize on duty or off duty, date or become overly friendly with the client&#8217;s employees or with co-employees.&#8221;
> 
> The board majority held that the guards probably would interpret this to be a no-dating rule, pure and simple. In her dissent, member Wilma Liebman wrote that the rule plainly specifies both dating and fraternizing, a term that covers a range of activities that go well beyond (or fall well short of) dating. That certainly was the reason that a San Francisco security guard local of the Service Employees International Union brought the case to the NLRB in the first place: The rule as written could preclude any attempt by the guards to meet to form a union, or even to talk about work-related issues.

> &#8230; it is now a precedent that can be applied to a far wider range of workers in a far wider range of situations. Indeed, as the precedent for this ruling, the board cited an earlier decision upholding the right of a hotel to ban its employees from fraternizing with guests. That hardly seems a parallel set of circumstances &#8212; closer to perpendicular, if you ask me &#8212; and it sure doesn&#8217;t inspire any confidence that the current board will seek to limit the impact of its Guardsmark ruling.
