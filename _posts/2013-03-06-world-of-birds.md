You&#8217;d think that Hualien, perched against the Pacific Ocean and separated by mountains from the concrete jungles of Taiwan&#8217;s West Coast, would be as far as one can get from where I grew up: New York City. And, indeed, it sometimes feels that way: like when I want a bagel, or an off-broadway play, or to hear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7nL4FcFCZY" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7nL4FcFCZY', 'John Zorn']);" >John Zorn</a> make some noise on his saxophone. But sometimes Hualien can remind me of home… in the most unexpected ways.

Sometimes you hear monkeys, or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kerim-friedman/circadian-rhythm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://soundcloud.com/kerim-friedman/circadian-rhythm', 'insects']);" >insects</a>, but most of the time you hear birds. Birdwatching in Taiwan is impossible if you aren&#8217;t trained to identify bird songs — the thick vegetation makes it impossible to see the birds, you can only hear them. A friend once bought me a CD of Taiwanese bird calls, but I never had the time to study them.

How is it that the sounds of a tropical forest in Taiwan could remind me of New York City? The answer lies in my annual childhood trips to the &#8220;Lila Acheson Wallace World of Birds&#8221; at the Bronx Zoo.

The second you walk in you hear the birds. I don&#8217;t remember the various bird species they had or even where they were from, but do I remember visiting the zoo as a kid and loving to spend time inside that magical world behind the concrete walls. Now, when I walk up the mountain behind my house, I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m still a kid at the zoo. As if my whole life is a dream and I&#8217;m still there, asleep on a bench in the World of Birds…
