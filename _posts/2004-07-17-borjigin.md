Actually, they *had* surnames, but they lost them. How do you loose your surname? Well, it seems that the use of Surnames was banned during the communist era in order to &#8220;eliminate the clan system, the hereditary aristocracy and the class structure.&#8221; But now they need them again, and unfortunately for the government bureaucracy, it seems <a href="http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/advice_on_mongo.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://foe.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/advice_on_mongo.html', 'everyone wants to have the surname &#8220;Borjigin&#8221;']);" >everyone wants to have the surname &#8220;Borjigin&#8221;</a>:

> Borjigin, the tribal name of Genghis Khan, has become the most popular name in the country. It means &#8220;master of the blue wolf,&#8221; a reference to Mongolia&#8217;s creation myth.
> 
> &#8220;Everyone wants the name Borjigin, as if they have some connection to Genghis Khan,&#8221; said Serjee Besud, director of Mongolia&#8217;s state library and a leading researcher on surnames.
> 
> &#8220;It&#8217;s like a fashion. But it has no meaning if everyone has the same name. It&#8217;s like having no name at all.&#8221;

Luckily for nameless Mongolians, the director of the State Library has unearthed a treasure trove of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/17/mongolians_need_surn.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/17/mongolians_need_surn.html', 'historically accurate Mongolian surnames']);" >historically accurate Mongolian surnames</a>:

> Mr. Besud has spent years poring over the dusty archives of the state library to compile a book of possible surnames for the nameless. He obtained access to the highly secret archives of the country&#8217;s Communist Party, which included detailed lists of the names of noble families who were prohibited from party membership.
> 
> He discovered his own long-lost surname, Besud, by finding his grandfather&#8217;s name on a 1925 list of conscripts in a Communist army.
> 
> His book, called Advice on Mongolian Surnames, provides maps and lists of historically used surnames in each region of the country.
