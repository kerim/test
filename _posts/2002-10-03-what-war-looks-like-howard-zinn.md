What really bothers me is that many people will read the following quote and think it is a perfectly reasonable statement for the Pentagon to make. Hey, they&#8217;re just doing their job, right?


>   &#8220;Ten years ago, in that first war against Iraq, our leaders were proud of the fact that there were only a few hundred American casualties (one wonders if the families of those soldiers would endorse the word "only"). When a reporter asked General Colin Powell if he knew how many Iraqis died in that war, he replied: "That is really not a matter I am terribly interested in." A high Pentagon official told The Boston Globe, "To tell you the truth, we&#8217;re not really focusing on this question."&#8221;
