A friend has co-produced a movie on the story Kerry has been trying hard to avoid telling &#8211; the true bravery he showed in speaking out against the Vietnam war. Directed by George Butler, who made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/', 'Pumping Iron']);" >Pumping Iron</a>,

Loosely based on the best-selling book Tour of Duty by Douglas Brinkley, Going Upriver examines the story of John Kerry and the key events that made him a national figure and the man he is today. The film places particular emphasis on his bravery during the Vietnam War and his courageous opposition to the war upon his return.

It&#8217;s opening in theaters October 1st, so <a href="http://movies.channel.aol.com/movie/main.adp?mid=19827" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://movies.channel.aol.com/movie/main.adp?mid=19827', 'go see it']);" >go see it</a>!
