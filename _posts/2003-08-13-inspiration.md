One myth that never seems to go away is the &#8220;divine inspiration&#8221; of the artist. People refuse to believe that artists work hard, study, take notes, etc., preferring to think of them as half-mad idiot-savants who are struck by the spirit of their work as if by a bolt of lightening.

For all my admiration for <a href="http://www.garyhartnews.com/hart/blog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.garyhartnews.com/hart/blog/', 'Gary Hart&#8217;s blogging']);" >Gary Hart&#8217;s blogging</a>, he is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/13/opinion/13DOWD.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/13/opinion/13DOWD.html', 'quoted by Maureen Dowd']);" >quoted by Maureen Dowd</a>, in today&#8217;s New York Times as saying something completely absurd:


>   Gary Hart, who began his blog in March, doesn&#8217;t bother to read other digital diarists. &#8220;If you&#8217;re James Joyce,&#8221; he said slyly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t read other authors.&#8221;


&#8220;Now there&#8217;s a man with a future in blogging.&#8221; she concludes. But he is simply wrong. Joyce, if anything, was one of history&#8217;s most avaricious readers. He loved the classics, of course, but also modern writers such as <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/tastes.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/tastes.html', 'Ibsen, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Yeats, Chekhov, Beckett, Dostoevski &#8230;']);" >Ibsen, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Yeats, Chekhov, Beckett, Dostoevski &#8230;</a>

Most of the great bloggers out there (look at the blogroll on the right) all are regular readers of each other&#8217;s blogs, and also seem to read lots of other blogs which I&#8217;ve never heard of. Inspiration, if there is such a thing, is 99% perspiration. True, the blogsphere can be a little introspective, and I always like to read bloggers who are reading books and articles, and not just other bloggers&#8230; but that is a different argument.
