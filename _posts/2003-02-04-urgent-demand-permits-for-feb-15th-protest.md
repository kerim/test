The organizers of the large anti-war rally planned for NY City on Feb. 15th have run against the Bloomberg administration which is stalling on the permits for the event. Please contact city officials at the numbers listed below to demand that permits be issued immediately!

If you are interested in receiving updates when permits are issued and a place has been assigned you can sign up <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&sub=30" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?list=sub&sub=30', 'here']);" >here</a>.


>   The reason we have not yet been able to provide a location for this event is simple: With less than two weeks left before Feb. 15, the City of New York has still not granted our request for a permit to march and rally. We have another meeting with the police on Tuesday, Feb. 4, and remain optimistic that an agreement will be reached.
