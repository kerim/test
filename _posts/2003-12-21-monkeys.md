Do you remember this advertisement from the back of comics you read when you were a kid? I sure do, which is why my attention was caught by the NY Times headline: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/national/21BRAU.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/national/21BRAU.html', 'Harold von Braunhut, Seller of Sea Monkeys, Dies at 77']);" >Harold von Braunhut, Seller of Sea Monkeys, Dies at 77</a>. It never occurred to me that one man could be behind such an important cultural phenomenon. He seems to have been quite a character:


>   Mr. von Braunhut gravitated toward life&#8217;s crazier edge, racing motorcycles as the Green Hornet and managing the career of a man who dived from 40 feet into a kiddie pool filled with 12 inches of water. He sold invisible goldfish by guaranteeing that owners would never see them.


How disappointing to also find out that he was allegedly a member of the K.K.K. (even though he was Jewish)&#8230;
