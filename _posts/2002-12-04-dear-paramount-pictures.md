>   &#8220;Iqbal Pittalwala&#8217;s first book of short stories is a very good read. Pittalwala has put together a fine portrayal of the characters in the stories as well as their own readings of their life situation. He has kept the style simple and the pages pretty much turn themselves. It calls to mind Rohinton Mistry&#8217;s writing in its somber take on life for, mostly, middle class "Bombayites". However, despite its dark world view, the book allows for a gently sly humor at the expense of the vivid characters that populate it.&#8221;
