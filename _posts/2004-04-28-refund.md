If you filed electronically, you probably already got your refund check, or you will soon. The more money you made last year the more likely you are to have gotten a fairly substantial break from Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. I know your first thought upon receiving that check is to pay off outstanding bills, credit card debt, buy much needed necessities etc&#8230; but please take a moment and **think**. That money didn&#8217;t come out of the US military budget, which has been increased by billions of dollars. It came at the expense of all those underfunded programs that provide a safety net for those worse off than yourself. Even more directly, it came at the expense of your future, since it is essentially a bad loan against our government&#8217;s finances. After thinking about that, perhaps you will donate some of that money to a <a href="http://www.heifer.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.heifer.org/', 'charity']);" >charity</a> (which you can write off on your taxes next year), or perhaps give that money to an organization devoted to driving Bush out of office. Even though <a href="https://www.moveon.org/donatec4/creditcard.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.moveon.org/donatec4/creditcard.html', 'donations to MoveOn.org']);" >donations to MoveOn.org</a> can&#8217;t be written off on your taxes, they might help you sleep a bit better at night!

And if you didn&#8217;t get any money back, but you still want to fight Bush. How about <a href="http://designsonthewhitehouse.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://designsonthewhitehouse.com/', 'designing a T-shirt']);" >designing a T-shirt</a>?
