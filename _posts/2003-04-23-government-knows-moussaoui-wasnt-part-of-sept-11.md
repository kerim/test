>   In short, the Government knows Moussaoui wasn&#8217;t part of Sept. 11&#8211;but to convict him on the conspiracy charge and have him sentenced to death, it must prove he was part of the September 11 conspiracy because that&#8217;s what it elected to charge him with. If Moussaoui is part of a different conspiracy involving Al Qaeda than the one charged in the Indictment, it won&#8217;t be enough.
