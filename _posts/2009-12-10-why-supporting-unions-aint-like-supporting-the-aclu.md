      Look, I support the ACLU. But, seriously; give those people everything they want, the whole Bill of Rights, and it would not cost the country a thing. It would be no big deal. Give labor anything it wants, even a lousy ten-man machine shop, and every drop of it is blood. It all comes out of a bottom line.
