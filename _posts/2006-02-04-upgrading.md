I&#8217;m in the middle of upgrading to WordPress 2.0.1. This has created all kinds of additional work with plugins and the like, so please hold on till everything is back to normal!

UPDATE: Seems to be working OK.

Some plugins are disabled for now, like the &#8220;recent comments&#8221; which used to appear in the sidebar. As soon as the developer releases an updated version I&#8217;ll fix that. Also I couldn&#8217;t get the &#8220;permalinks&#8221; to upgrade properly, but the old ones still seem to work&#8230;

I&#8217;m now using the new built-in WordPress spam blocking software, so we&#8217;ll see how that works.

If you notice anything funky let me know!
