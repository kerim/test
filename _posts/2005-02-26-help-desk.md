A new <a href="http://netscape.com.com/2100-9589_22-5516767.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://netscape.com.com/2100-9589_22-5516767.html', 'ad campaign']);" >ad campaign</a> from IBM &#8220;shows a young Chinese girl asking to join a virtual classroom because her village is too far from the nearest school.&#8221; Thanks to IBM she can take her seat next to American kids in a Matrix inspired classroom. What the ad doesn&#8217;t show you, however, is that <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/02/25/2003224500" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/02/25/2003224500', 'the virtual teacher for these American kids is in India']);" >the virtual teacher for these American kids is in India</a>:

> American schools desperate to improve their students&#8217; math grades are hiring Indian companies who provide tutors at a fraction of the cost of American tutors. These tutors sit in New Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore helping youngsters with their math homework or going over already-learnt concepts so that they do not lose ground during the holidays.
