It seems that there is some credence to Fox News&#8217; claims to deliver balanced reporting. Even though they were more overtly pro-war than any other network news outlet, FAIR has <a href="http://www.fair.org/extra/0305/warstudy.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fair.org/extra/0305/warstudy.html', 'a report']);" >a report</a> which shows they also had more anti-war guests than either PBS or CBC!!!


>   Though Fox News Channel frequently engaged in overt cheerleading for the war and is on record as considering itself a pro-war news outlet (Baltimore Sun, 4/2/03), Fox&#8217;s Special Report with Brit Hume had fewer U.S. officials than CBS (70 percent) and more U.S. anti-war guests (3 percent) than PBS or CBS. Eighty-one percent of Fox&#8217;s sources were pro-war, however, the highest of any network.


Of course, the problem with such statistics is that they don&#8217;t show the time or environment under which those views were aired. It doesn&#8217;t much count if you bring on anti-war voices just to make fun of them, or tell them to &#8220;shut up&#8221; (as O&#8217;Reilly does regularly).
