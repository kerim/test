It turns out that most people come to my web site from doing a google search for something or another &#8211; often not finding what they are looking for. Here are the top three searches that bring people to the site, with the number of searches for this month:

betel nut beauties 13  
  
dvd enabler download 11  
  
sarah shahi nude 8

The first one makes sense, I had <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=677" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=677', 'an article']);" >an article</a> on that. The second is a mistake, because on my info-tech weblog I listed an article about how this software would <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=587" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=587', 'no longer be available']);" >no longer be available</a> for download. But at least the information is relavent to the person doing the search. The third is completely off, and people searching google should learn to use quote marks. If you put this Dallas Cowboy cheerleader&#8217;s name in quotes you will find her site, instead of sites which have names like <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=525" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=525', '&#8220;Adil Shahi&#8221;']);" >&#8220;Adil Shahi&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=664" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://kerim.oxus.net/nucleus/index.php?itemid=664', 'other']);" >other</a> articles which only make this phrase if you look a three separate articles from my blog. Of course, now that I&#8217;ve posted this article putting quote marks won&#8217;t help! But it doesn&#8217;t matter, you probably won&#8217;t find what you are looking for anyway.
