Advice to Kerry (or whoever the Democratic candidate turns out to be):

<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=17574" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=17574', 'Re-frame']);" >Re-frame</a> the issue of &#8220;gay marriage&#8221; as an issue of women&#8217;s rights. Efforts to re-define marriage in terms of heterosexual procreation are an attack on years of feminist efforts to separate biology from destiny. Re-frame the issue of &#8220;gay marriage&#8221; as an issue of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/10/EDGI24R9LV1.DTL" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/10/EDGI24R9LV1.DTL', 'state&#8217;s rights']);" >state&#8217;s rights</a>. &#8220;The Massachusetts Supreme Court based its ruling entirely on its own state constitution.&#8221; The burden should be on the Republican&#8217;s to justify such drastic federal intervention.

Kerry has unfortunately come out against gay marriage, even as he supports gay rights. <a href="http://www.serve.com/bonzai/monty/classics/TheArchitectSketch" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.serve.com/bonzai/monty/classics/TheArchitectSketch', 'In the words of John Cleese']);" >In the words of John Cleese</a>:

> &#8230;this is just the sort of blinkered philistine ignorance I&#8217;ve come to expect from you non-creative garbage.

UPDATE: Anyone interested in the issue of Single Sex Marriage should <a href="http://www.marriagedebate.com/mdblog.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.marriagedebate.com/mdblog.php', 'check out this blog']);" >check out this blog</a> devoted to the topic.
