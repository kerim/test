In my <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/02/14/churchill/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/02/14/churchill/', 'last post']);" >last post</a> on Ward Churchill, I wrote:

I would like to modify my stance. I&#8217;ve had some time to look into the matter more closely, and I find myself in agreement with the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=17445&#038;c=42" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=17445&c=42', 'ACLU of Colorado']);" >ACLU of Colorado</a> which says:

> The Regents should take care that the Chancellor&#8217;s investigation of Mr. Churchill&#8217;s competence is not a fishing expedition to find something &#8212; anything &#8212; to use as an excuse to fire him. If that happens, their action will be subjected to a high level of scrutiny to determine if it is really a guise to fire him for the content of his writing.

Similarly, the <a href="http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/5305.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/5305.html', 'Foundation for Individual Rights in Education']);" >Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> says:

> We would further like to emphasize that accusations of unrelated wrongdoing should not be used as excuses to justify punishment of the professor for his political expression.

These are important points.
