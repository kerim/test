Here is a special clause in the &#8220;Terms of Service&#8221; agreement that the Kerry campaign will be automatically agreeing to by accepting any money from me this year:

> (xxxvi) The Kerry Campaign, by accepting this money, consents to the fact that, in the event that John F. Kerry wins the election, the campaign donor reserves the right to attack President Kerry for following narrow minded centrist policies <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/000311.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/000311.html', 'here']);" >here</a> and <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/001402.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://billmon.org/archives/001402.html', 'abroad']);" >abroad</a>.

A less negative assessment of Kerry&#8217;s fiscal policy <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001646.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/001646.shtml', 'here']);" >here</a>.

I wish Kerry were running a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=18291" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=18291', 'more populist and leftist campaign']);" >more populist and leftist campaign</a>, because I think the ideological landscape of American politics is ripe for change. But I&#8217;m willing to give Kerry the benefit of doubt till after the election &#8211; I just hope that his centrism is as much of an election ploy as was Bush&#8217;s &#8220;compassionate conservatism.&#8221;
