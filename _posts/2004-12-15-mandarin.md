On the plane to India I read a <a href="http://www.nybooks.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nybooks.com', 'NYRB']);" ><em>NYRB</em></a> article on the history of trade (in goods and ideas) between India and China by Amartya Sen. In a footnote he answered a question which I&#8217;d long wondered about but never bothered to investigate: What is the origin of the term &#8220;Mandarin&#8221;?

> The term &#8220;Mandarin,&#8221; from the Sanskrit word *mantri*, or special advisor (the Indian prime minister is still called *pradhan mantri*, or principal adviser), came much later, via Malaya.

Sen also provides this history of the term &#8220;sine&#8221;:

> An interesting example of the transmission of mathematical dieas and terms can be seen in the origin of the trigonometric term &#8220;sine.&#8221; In his Sanksrit mathematical treatise completed in 499 AD, Aryabhata used *jya-ardha* (Sankscrit for &#8220;chord half&#8221;), shortened later into *jya*, for what we now call &#8220;sine.&#8221; Arab mathematicians in the eighth century transliterated the Sanskrit word *jya* into the proximate sound of *jiba* and then later changed it into *jaib* (with the same consonants as *jiba*), which is a good Arabic word, meaning a bay or a cove, and it was this word that was later translated by Gherardo of Cremona (circa 1150) into its equivalent Latin word for a bay or a cove, viz., *sinus*, from which the modern term &#8220;sine&#8221; is derived.

He then goes on to say that it was the earlier term, *jya*, which was translated into Chinese as *ming*. (Unfortunately, lacking a Chinese-enabled computer I can&#8217;t look up the character, but I&#8217;ll try to add it later.)
