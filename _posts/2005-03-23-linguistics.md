Mark Liberman is <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001978.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001978.html', 'correct']);" >correct</a> to state that French post-structuralist theory, is not derived from what we, today, consider to be &#8220;linguistics,&#8221; and if he had left it there I would not have felt compelled to respond. However, I feel he overstates his case when he <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001998.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001998.html', 'compares']);" >compares</a> the semiotics of Roland Barthes to a &#8220;cargo cult,&#8221; no matter how cute and apt his analogy might be in regards to the crisis engendered by the failures of 60s radicalism. I feel compelled to respond to the *tone* of his message by putting linguistics in its rightful place &#8211; genealogically speaking that is.

Here is a quote from Saussure&#8217;s classic *Course in General Linguistics* (p. 15), with some added emphasis:

> §3. Languages and their place in human affairs. Semiology  
> 
> The above characteristics lead us to realize another, which is more important. A language defined in this way from among the totality of facts of language, has a particular place in the realm of human affairs, whereas language does not.
> 
> **A language, as we have just seen, is a social institution**. But it is in various respects distinct from political, juridical and other institutions. Its special nature emerges when we bring into consideration a different order of facts.
> 
> A  language is a system of signs expressing ideas, and hence comparable to writing, the deaf-and-dumb alphabet, symbolic rites, forms of politeness, military signals, and so on. It is simply the most important of such systems.
> 
> **It is therefore possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part social life**. It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology. We shall call it *semiology* (from the Greek *semeion*, &#8216;sign&#8217;). It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance. **Linguistics is only one branch of this general science. The laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge**.

The positivism of contemporary linguistics has bucked the Saussurian tradition by abstracting language from the social institutions in which it is embedded. (NB: Mark Liberman and his fellow <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/', 'Language Loggers']);" >Language Loggers</a> depart from that stereotype and do a generally admirable job of discussing the social uses of language.) Linguistics, for Saussure, was a sub-field of semiotics, and those thinkers who drew from this tradition steadfastly refused to reduce language to a purely psychological phenomenon. Derrida and Bourdieu, for instance, were clearly interested in speech act theory and discourse analysis, even if they didn&#8217;t engage in the practices associated with contemporary phonology, morphology, or syntax.
