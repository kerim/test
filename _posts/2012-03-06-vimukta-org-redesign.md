Henry Schwarz, Alan Sussman, Shashwati and I created <a href="http://vimukta.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vimukta.org', 'Vimukta']);" >Vimukta</a> to help support <a href="http://budhantheatre.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://budhantheatre.org', 'Budhan Theatre&#8217;s']);" >Budhan Theatre&#8217;s</a> community development activities. For the past few years we&#8217;ve been supporting a <a href="http://vimukta.org/2008/09/02/more-than-a-library/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vimukta.org/2008/09/02/more-than-a-library/', 'community library']);" >community library</a> and informal school in the community, but now that <a href="http://dontbeatmesir.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dontbeatmesir.com', 'the film']);" >the film</a> is coming out we are getting ready to support more ambitious projects. To prepare for that we needed to launch a social media campaign centered around a website redesign. For the past month I&#8217;ve been working with Kellen Parker of <a href="http://www.spectaclecreative.com/main/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spectaclecreative.com/main/', 'Spectacle Creative Media']);" >Spectacle Creative Media</a> who has been very generous with his time helping me achieve what I think is a look that reflects something of the community we work with. A site that is neither generic nor corporate nor stereotypical of the numerous clichés of Indian non-profits. I hope we have achieved what we set out to do.

Before we make the site &#8220;live&#8221; however, we need to be sure that it works on a variety of computers and web browsers. For that reason we are asking people to take a look at a demo site. When you visit the demo site, please note that much of the text, the video and some of the images are just temporary. They will be updated when we launch the campaign later this month. It is also on a slow server, so be patient if things don&#8217;t open immediately. Also, because it is a demo site, please don&#8217;t link to it. That said, please click around, let us know what works, what you think could be improved, and what is completely broken. You can leave your feedback in the comments, or by email (there is a link at the top of the page). Please be as specific as possible with your criticism, and provide screen shots wherever possible.

Here is <a href="http://ksyzp.webfactional.com/vimukta/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ksyzp.webfactional.com/vimukta/', 'the link to the demo site']);" >the link to the demo site</a>. A screen shot of the front page is below the fold.

Thank you!

UPDATE: It seems the site is still not working well on <del datetime="2012-03-06T07:05:19+00:00">Firefox or</del> I.E. I will update this when we&#8217;ve addressed those problems. (The picture below shows how it should look.) [Firefox problems should be fixed now. Still working on I.E.]
