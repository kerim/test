It is hard to understate the dramatic nature of the transformation <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/page/budhan-theatre" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com/page/budhan-theatre', 'Budhan Theatre']);" >Budhan Theatre</a> has wrought on Chharangar. In the past, only policemen and customers of the locally brewed illegal liquor would dare venture into this urban ghetto; now, even if their neighbors still dare not venture into the community, the rest of the world comes to Chharanagar on a daily basis.

While Shashwati and I were there we had a chance to meet: journalist <a href="http://dcubed.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dcubed.blogspot.com/', 'Dilip D&#8217;Souza']);" >Dilip D&#8217;Souza</a>, scholar and activist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=8170226929%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/8170226929%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=shashwaticom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=8170226929%2526tag=shashwaticom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/8170226929%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002', 'Ajay Dandekar']);" >Ajay Dandekar</a>, playwright and journalist <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/07/08/stories/2005070802450300.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/07/08/stories/2005070802450300.htm', 'Pranab Mukherjee']);" >Pranab Mukherjee</a>, religion professor Greg Alles along with a group of students from <a href="http://www.mcdaniel.edu/news/archive05/india.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mcdaniel.edu/news/archive05/india.shtml', 'McDaniel College']);" >McDaniel College</a>, filmmaker <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/06/23/whats-happening-in-kashipur-invited-post/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/06/23/whats-happening-in-kashipur-invited-post/', 'Vinod Raja']);" >Vinod Raja</a>, and others. It seemed that if we sat for long enough in front of <a href="http://roxygagdekar.blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://roxygagdekar.blogspot.com', 'Roxy&#8217;s']);" >Roxy&#8217;s</a> house, we would eventually meet just about every socially conscious writer, scholar, or artist passing through Gujarat.

The Budhan Theatre has indeed transformed Chharanagar from an urben ghetto on the periphery of a huge city into <a href="http://roxygagdekar.blogspot.com/2005/12/place-with-most-cultural-activities-in.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://roxygagdekar.blogspot.com/2005/12/place-with-most-cultural-activities-in.html', 'the cultural center of Ahmedabad']);" >the cultural center of Ahmedabad</a>! Back in the cultural wasteland of New York City, I already miss Chharanagar, and all the new friends I&#8217;ve made there, especially the volunteers of the Budhan Theatre and their families.
