So you want me to give you all my personal data? Don&#8217;t make it any more difficult than it has to be.

  * Don&#8217;t make me fill it out more than once. Something is incorrect or missing? Let me come back and fix it later. 
  * Make it very, very, clear why your system isn&#8217;t accepting my data. 
  * Don&#8217;t use selection boxes. 
  * Don&#8217;t ask for data you don&#8217;t need. 
  * Don&#8217;t tell me I entered invalid characters. Deal with it. (BTW: Valid e-mail addresses can have plus signs.) 
  * Don&#8217;t make me reload the form to see if my username is taken. Learn AJAX! 
  * Support <a href="http://openid.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://openid.net/', 'OpenID']);" >OpenID</a>!
