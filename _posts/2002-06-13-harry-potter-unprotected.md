>   &#8220;Like all major movies, Harry Potter was widely pirated before its official release. Macrovisions-busters can also be bought, often disguised by names such as &#8216;signal cleaners&#8217; to keep within the law. By not protecting Harry Potter, Time Warner has saved the five US cents or so per disc or tape that Macrovision charges. Analysts suspect that Warner left the release unprotected, to investigate whether this would have a significant impact on sales.&#8221;
