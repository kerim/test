In the <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/25/snooze/#comment-5417" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/25/snooze/#comment-5417', 'comments']);" >comments</a> to a post I wrote about various devices designed to get you out of bed in the morning, Tim May directed my attention to the <a href="http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/sleeptracker_watch_review_03221147/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/sleeptracker_watch_review_03221147/', 'Sleeptracker Alarm Watch']);" >Sleeptracker Alarm Watch</a>.

> The SLEEPTRACKER watch is unique in that while it tells you the time and has a built-in alarm like every other digital watch, this one actually monitors your sleep and wakes you at the moment that your body would best adjust from moving from a sleeping state to being awake.

I didn&#8217;t post it at the time because I couldn&#8217;t figure out how it was supposed to work; however, today Tim May posted a <a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/25/snooze/#comment-8922" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/2005/03/25/snooze/#comment-8922', 'followup']);" >followup</a> comment in which he elaborates:

> There’s an interview with the inventor of the Sleeptracker <a href="http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/interview_with_lee_loree_sleeptracker_inventor_04131225/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/interview_with_lee_loree_sleeptracker_inventor_04131225/', 'here']);" >here</a>. Turns out the sensory side of it’s simpler than you might expect &#8211; it just detects motion. I can imagine that working (although it’s not obvious that it would) and it’s certainly a lot simpler than somehow getting an [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:eeg&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;oe=UTF-8" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/search?q=define:eeg&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8', 'EEG']);" >EEG</a>] through someone’s wrist.

That sounds great, and the <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/clocks-and-watches/sleepwatcher-alarm-watch-reviewed-verdict-fantastic-037050.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/clocks-and-watches/sleepwatcher-alarm-watch-reviewed-verdict-fantastic-037050.php', 'reviews']);" >reviews</a> seem to indicate that it works as advertised. Tim points out that there is also a group of students at Brown University are working on an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/mech-tech/mg18624956.600" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newscientist.com/channel/mech-tech/mg18624956.600', 'EEG that you can wear to sleep']);" >EEG that you can wear to sleep</a>.

I am like <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000107038796/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000107038796/', 'many other people']);" >many other people</a> who no longer wear a wristwatch now that I always carry a cell phone, so I&#8217;m not sure I could get in the habit of wearing one to sleep at night, but I can imagine this being great for afternoon naps, where I always worry about oversleeping and ending up feeling groggy the rest of the day. Assuming I can find the damn thing and put it on before I fall asleep!
