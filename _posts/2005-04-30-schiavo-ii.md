> A pregnant 13-year-old girl in Florida has been told she cannot have an abortion because she lacks the maturity to make such a decision.

Her legal guardian is *the state of Florida*. I wouldn&#8217;t wish a fate like that on my worst enemy.

The BBC has this caption under a photo of two girls with baby strollers:

> Some say forcing a 13-year-old to give birth is illegal and cruel.

Poor girl. In addition to having Florida for parents and being pregnant at the age of 13, she is going to also be America&#8217;s newest political football.
