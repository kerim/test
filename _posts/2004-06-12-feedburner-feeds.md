One of the big problems with running a full-text newsfeed on your website is that it makes it difficult to keep track of how many people are reading your blog. On the other hand, for people like myself who use software like <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/', 'NetNewsWire']);" >NetNewsWire</a>, or <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp', 'FeedDemon']);" >FeedDemon</a> to read all their favorite blogs, it is very annoying when sites only provide summaries instead of full feeds (hint, hint). One solution is to use the new service, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedburner.com/', 'FeedBurner']);" >FeedBurner</a>. They syndicate your feed for you, and provide extensive statistics on how people are using your feed. <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.feedburner.com/', 'Check it out']);" >Check it out</a>! [See all &#8220;feeds&#8221; posts 

<a href="http://test.oxus.net/archives/cat_feeds.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://test.oxus.net/archives/cat_feeds.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.] 

(Note: I&#8217;m now running my feeds through FeedDemon as well, so if you notice something strange, let me know!)
