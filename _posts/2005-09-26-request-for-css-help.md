I&#8217;ve been working on a revision of the <a href="http://dnt.shashwati.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dnt.shashwati.com/', 'Hooch and Hamlet in Chharanagar']);" >Hooch and Hamlet in Chharanagar</a> web site, and I&#8217;m really happy with how it looks. Unfortunately, the code I&#8217;m using doesn&#8217;t seem to play well with Internet Explorer even though it looks great in Firefox and Safari. I&#8217;m hoping that someone out there really understands CSS and can help out. If so, please take a look <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/45476" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/topic/45476', 'here']);" >here</a>.

It is really urgent that I get this site working properly on MSIE before I launch it publicly, and we&#8217;d like to launch it ASAP.

If you have Firefox you can take a sneak peek at the new site <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com/', 'here']);" >here</a>. But please don&#8217;t link to it until we have the problems solved!

Thanks!

UPDATE: I finally figured out what was causing the problem and then, with some help from Google, I found <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/expandingboxbug.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/expandingboxbug.html', 'this article']);" >this article</a> which offered a solution.

If you can, please help me out by looking at <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hoochandhamlet.com/', 'the site']);" >the site</a> on a few different browsers and platforms and let me know if you find any strange behavior.
