>   Wal-Mart has already helped push more than two dozen national supermarket chains into bankruptcy over the past decade. That list includes names like Grand Union; Bruno&#8217;s, once Alabama&#8217;s largest supermarket chain; and Homeland Stores, formerly Oklahoma&#8217;s largest. And unionized supermarket workers fear that Wal-Mart&#8217;s invasion will oust them from the middle class by pulling down their wages and benefits, which, taken together, are more than 50 percent higher than those of Wal-Mart workers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/weekinreview/19GREE.html?ex=1067140800&#38;en=abefc0751d34d703&#38;ei=5062&#38;partner=GOOGLE" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/weekinreview/19GREE.html?ex=1067140800&en=abefc0751d34d703&ei=5062&partner=GOOGLE', 'At Wal-Mart, the average wage is about $8.50 an hour, compared with $13 at unionized supermarkets.']);" >At Wal-Mart, the average wage is about $8.50 an hour, compared with $13 at unionized supermarkets.</a>

But the larger story is this:

Which is what the supermarket strike in California is all about &#8211; attempting to hold on to a middle class lifestyle in an increasingly polarized economy. Aren&#8217;t we all? No wonder nobody is crossing the picket line!
